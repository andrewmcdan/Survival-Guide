# Situational Awareness

## Overview
Awareness buys time, and time buys options. Build fast baselines, spot meaningful anomalies, and pre‑plan branches so you can pivot early. Couple awareness with the STOP reset and the OODA loop to translate observation into action.

## Baselines
Know what “normal” looks like so you notice “not normal.”

- People: Typical foot traffic, behavior, clothing for weather/time.
- Place: Usual sounds, lighting, vehicle flow, open/closed spaces.
- Time: What changes by hour/day/season.

💡 Tip: Build a 10‑second baseline on arrival: stand still and listen first, then scan.

## Anomalies
An anomaly is anything that doesn’t fit the baseline; it’s not automatically a threat.

- Categorize: Harmless oddity vs. potential hazard vs. opportunity (e.g., shelter).
- Prioritize: Proximity, momentum toward you, ability to affect you.
- Verify: Cross‑check with a second sense or a teammate callout before acting.

📝 Note: “Left of bang” thinking—notice precursors before problems fully form.

## What-If Trees
Pre‑planning branches reduces panic and accelerates good choices.

- Make 2–3 branches for the top risks: weather turn, injury, separation, comms failure.
- Tie branches to triggers and actions (PACE and decision points).

Example — Urban power outage:
- If elevators stop → Take stairs down now, don’t wait; rendezvous at lobby desk.
- If cell data drops → Switch to SMS with WHO/WHERE/WHEN/WHAT/INTENT; conserve battery.
- If street becomes congested → Avoid intersections; move via side streets; meet at Park‑N garage L2.

## Light Discipline
Be seen when helpful, be invisible when not.

- Night navigation: Angle light down; use lowest usable brightness; prefer warm/red modes.
- Indoors: Cup light to reduce spill; bounce off walls/ceilings for diffuse light.
- Signaling: Switch to high output and strobes only when you intend to be found.

⚠️ Caution: White light ruins night vision; protect a designated “no‑light navigator” if possible.

## Sound Discipline
Sound travels far in quiet environments; noise draws attention and masks other cues.

- Movement: Place feet softly; control loose gear; avoid clacking metal.
- Comms: Pre‑brief hand signals; keep radio traffic short and plain.
- Tools: Pad clattery items; secure zippers and straps; stow loose carabiners.

## Scent Discipline
Odors carry on wind and stick to clothing and gear.

- Food: Cook downwind and away from sleeping areas; seal trash.
- Smoke: Minimize in high‑risk or low‑viz environments; avoid inside shelters.
- Fuels/Chemicals: Store tightly sealed; avoid spills; don’t open near living areas.

☑️ Checklist — 5×5×5 Scan
- Every 5 minutes: pause 5 seconds, scan 5 directions (front, left, right, up, back) at 5 distances (immediate, 5 m, 25 m, 100 m, horizon) if visibility allows.

Examples
- Trail cresting to leeward: Baseline = wind noise up, temps down; Anomaly = fresh cornice cracks → back off ridge by 10 m.
- Parking garage at night: Baseline = cars parked, echoing steps; Anomaly = idling vehicle without driver → choose alternate exit, keep distance, observe.

## Key Takeaways
- Take 10 seconds to build a baseline on arrival; re‑scan on a timer in dynamic settings.
- Label anomalies and verify before acting; prioritize by proximity and momentum toward you.
- Pre‑build 2–3 what‑if branches for top risks; tie them to triggers and actions.
- Control light, sound, and scent signatures deliberately; don’t let them control you.
