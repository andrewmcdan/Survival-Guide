# Basic Troubleshooting

## No-Start Triage
### Battery
Common cause. Dome lights dim? Clicking? Measure if you can: <12.0 V = low, ~12.6 V = full. Look for corrosion/loose terminals.

### Starter
Single loud click → solenoid engages but starter doesn’t spin; repeated rapid clicks → low battery. Tap starter lightly while turning key (temporary).

### Fuel
Listen for pump prime 1–2 seconds at key‑on. Low fuel or clogged filter gives sputter/no start. Add fuel if suspect and safe.

### Fuses
Check fuse box diagram; pull and inspect related fuses (ECM, fuel pump, IGN). Replace with same amperage only.

### Immobilizer Indicators
Flashing key/light may indicate immobilizer lockout. Try spare key, lock/unlock cycle, or consult manual for reset.

## Using a Jump Pack
Safer than cables; follow device instructions.

- Off vehicle ignition; connect positive (+) to battery positive, negative (−) to engine ground (unpainted metal), not battery negative if accessible.
- Power jump pack; start vehicle; disconnect in reverse order.
- Keep bystanders clear of moving parts; avoid sparks.

## Safe Jump-Start Procedure
If using another vehicle:

- Park close but not touching; both ignitions off; connect cables: dead +, donor +, donor −, dead − (to ground). Start donor; wait 3–5 minutes; start dead vehicle.
- After start: Remove cables in reverse order; keep engine running to recharge.

## Alternator Quick Checks
Battery light on while driving? Dimming lights with RPM change? Measure voltage if possible: running should be ~13.8–14.4 V. If <13 V, alternator/drive belt issue.

## Overheating Response
Turn off AC; turn heat on high to shed heat; pull over safely. Do not open radiator cap hot. After cool, check coolant level in overflow, belt, and leaks.

## Limp-Home Decisions
Stop if: oil pressure light on; temp in red; brakes compromised; steering failure; charging failure at night. Continue cautiously only if risk is controlled (e.g., daytime, short distance to safe stop).

☑️ Checklist — No‑Start/Overheat Kit
- OBD‑II reader; basic fuse kit
- Jump pack/cables; gloves/eye protection
- Tire plug kit + compressor; coolant rated for vehicle; funnel/rags
- Flashlight/headlamp; triangles/high‑viz vest

Examples
- Grocery lot no‑start: Dome lights dim, rapid clicking → low battery. Jump pack start; drive 20–30 minutes, test alternator soon.
- Hill climb temp spike: Heater on full; safe pull‑off; cool; overflow tank low—top with correct mix; inspect for leaks; plan service.

## Key Takeaways
- Diagnose simply: battery/terminals, fuel, fuses, immobilizer.
- Jump safely; avoid opening hot cooling systems; decide prudently to stop vs limp.
- Basic kit covers 80% of roadside problems.
