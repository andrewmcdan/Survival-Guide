# Basic Troubleshooting

## Overview
When a car won’t start or overheats, a simple, safe triage beats random part swaps. Start with battery/terminals, fuses/relays, and immobilizer clues; then separate no‑crank from crank‑no‑start. Use jump packs carefully, avoid opening hot cooling systems, and decide early whether to stop or limp home.

## No-Start Triage
### Battery
Common cause. Dome lights dim? Clicking? Measure if you can: <12.0 V = low, ~12.6 V = full. Look for corrosion/loose terminals.

### Starter
Single loud click → solenoid engages but starter doesn’t spin; repeated rapid clicks → low battery. Tap starter lightly while turning key (temporary).

### Fuel
Listen for pump prime 1–2 seconds at key‑on. Low fuel or clogged filter gives sputter/no start. Add fuel if suspect and safe.

### Fuses
Check fuse box diagram; pull and inspect related fuses (ECM, fuel pump, IGN). Replace with same amperage only.

### Immobilizer Indicators
Flashing key/light may indicate immobilizer lockout. Try spare key, lock/unlock cycle, or consult manual for reset.

### Neutral/Clutch Safety Switch
Auto transmissions require Park/Neutral; manuals require clutch fully depressed. Try starting in Neutral; wiggle shifter through ranges; press clutch firmly. If it cranks in Neutral but not Park, suspect range sensor/shift linkage.

### Relays (Starter/Fuel Pump)
Listen/feel for relay clicks at key‑on. Swap a suspect relay with an identical non‑critical one (e.g., horn) to test. Inspect for melted pins. Seat relays fully.

### Security/Aftermarket Devices
Aftermarket alarms/kill‑switches can block starts. Check hidden toggles or poorly crimped add‑ons near battery/ignition; restore to stock if needed.

## Using a Jump Pack
Safer than cables; follow device instructions.

- Off vehicle ignition; connect positive (+) to battery positive, negative (−) to engine ground (unpainted metal), not battery negative if accessible.
- Power jump pack; start vehicle; disconnect in reverse order.
- Keep bystanders clear of moving parts; avoid sparks.

## Safe Jump-Start Procedure
If using another vehicle:

- Park close but not touching; both ignitions off; connect cables: dead +, donor +, donor −, dead − (to ground). Start donor; wait 3–5 minutes; start dead vehicle.
- After start: Remove cables in reverse order; keep engine running to recharge.

## Alternator Quick Checks
Battery light on while driving? Dimming lights with RPM change? Measure voltage if possible: running should be ~13.8–14.4 V. If <13 V, alternator/drive belt issue.

## Overheating Response
Turn off AC; turn heat on high to shed heat; pull over safely. Do not open radiator cap hot. After cool, check coolant level in overflow, belt, and leaks. Verify cooling fans run when hot or when AC is on; no cabin heat can indicate very low coolant.

⚠️ Caution: Steam = stop. Don’t douse a hot engine with cold water; avoid spraying water on hot electronics.

💡 Tip: If a hose collapses as RPM rises, suspect a clogged radiator cap or blocked hose.

## No-Crank vs Crank-No-Start Flow
No‑crank (key turns but engine doesn’t rotate)
- Battery/terminals: Clean/tighten; try jump pack.
- Shifter/clutch: Try Neutral; fully depress clutch; check that brake is pressed on push‑button starts.
- Starter/relay: Listen for single click (solenoid) vs silence; tap starter body lightly while turning key (temporary); swap starter relay with identical.
- Immobilizer: Watch for key icon; try spare key; lock/unlock cycle.

Crank‑no‑start (engine turns but won’t fire)
- Fuel: Listen for 1–2 s pump prime at key‑on; add safe amount of fuel if low; check fuel pump fuse/relay.
- Air: Ensure air intake isn’t blocked; check for rodent nests/filters soaked in water.
- Spark: If safe and trained, use an inline spark tester; otherwise, read OBD‑II for misfires/sensor failures; avoid pulling coils/wires on modern engines without tools.
- Sensors: Loose MAF/MAP connectors or vacuum hoses can cause stalls/no start after recent work.

## Limp-Home Decisions
Stop if: oil pressure light on; temp in red; brakes compromised; steering failure; charging failure at night. Continue cautiously only if risk is controlled (e.g., daytime, short distance to safe stop).

☑️ Checklist — No‑Start/Overheat Kit
- OBD‑II reader; basic fuse kit
- Jump pack/cables; gloves/eye protection
- Tire plug kit + compressor; coolant rated for vehicle; funnel/rags
- Flashlight/headlamp; triangles/high‑viz vest

Examples
- Grocery lot no‑start: Dome lights dim, rapid clicking → low battery. Jump pack start; drive 20–30 minutes, test alternator soon.
- Hill climb temp spike: Heater on full; safe pull‑off; cool; overflow tank low—top with correct mix; inspect for leaks; plan service.

## Field Tests Without Tools
- Headlight load test: Turn headlights on; crank. If lights die completely, suspect weak battery/connection; if they stay bright and no crank, suspect starter or safety switch.
- Neutral test: Try to start in Neutral instead of Park.
- Relay swap: Swap identical relays (e.g., horn ↔ starter) to isolate.
- Belt check: Press on belt mid‑span; heavy cracks/glazing or very loose belts can cause charging/cooling failures.

## Common Mistakes
- Opening a hot radiator cap; serious burn risk.
- Jumping with reversed polarity or clamping to battery negative instead of engine ground.
- Clearing codes before reading/recording them; losing freeze‑frame data.
- Cranking endlessly and overheating the starter (let cool between attempts).

## Key Takeaways
- Diagnose simply: battery/terminals, fuel, fuses, immobilizer.
- Jump safely; avoid opening hot cooling systems; decide prudently to stop vs limp.
- Basic kit covers 80% of roadside problems.

## Scenario

```
🧭 Scenario (Grocery lot no‑start): Rapid clicks, dome light dim.
🔍 Decisions: Battery vs starter; jump pack vs call; immobilizer light?
✅ Outcome: You spot a loose terminal, tighten, jump with a pack, and drive to test the alternator.
🧠 Lessons: Terminals first; jump packs are gold
🏋️ Drill: Identify your fuse box and battery tie‑downs at home.
