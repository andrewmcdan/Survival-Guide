# Movement Without Driving

## Overview
Sometimes you need to move a vehicle that won‚Äôt start or shift. Use manufacturer‚Äëapproved methods to put the transmission in neutral, and move/push/tow safely with clear communication. Never defeat security or operate illegally.

## Neutral Override
Modern vehicles often have a hidden shifter release.

- Check manual: Look for ‚Äúshift lock release‚Äù near the shifter; often a small cover hides a slot for a key/tool.
- Electric parking brakes: Some vehicles require a specific procedure or power to release; consult manual.

## Pushing Safely
Assign a driver to steer/brake with ignition in accessory if needed (no power steering/brakes may increase effort). Push from structural areas; do not place feet behind wheels; use spotter hand signals.

## Calling a Tow
Know your location and needs.

- Provide: Vehicle make/model, issue (won‚Äôt start/flat), location (with landmarks/coords), where to tow.
- Request: Flatbed vs wheel‚Äëlift per drivetrain; ask about ETA and safety instructions.

## Winch Basics (If Equipped)
Respect line forces and safety zones.

- Anchor: Solid tree/vehicle with tree‚Äësaver strap; straight line pulls preferred.
- Setup: Gloves on; use dampener/blanket mid‚Äëline; keep bystanders well clear; never straddle a loaded line.
- Communication: One leader controls the operation; clear start/stop signals.

## Legal/Ethical Access to Keys
Only move/enter vehicles with owner consent or under direction of authorities. Use locksmiths or roadside assistance for lockouts. Document actions if you move an unattended vehicle at official request.

‚òëÔ∏è Checklist ‚Äî Move Without Driving
- Confirm neutral (per manual); parking brake status known
- Spotters positioned; clear hand signals; path checked
- Push/pull slowly; never place body where it can be pinned
- Stop if steering/braking insufficient; escalate to tow

Examples
- Dead battery in garage: Shift lock release to neutral; two pushers + one driver; small chocks ready; roll to open drive for jump.
- Stuck in mud: Reduce tire pressure slightly; clear in front of drive wheels; gentle rocking; if winching, dampen line and set wide safety perimeter.
