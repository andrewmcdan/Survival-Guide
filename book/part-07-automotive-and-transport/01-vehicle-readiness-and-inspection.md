# Vehicle Readiness & Inspection

## Overview
Most roadside emergencies are preventable. A 5–10 minute pre‑trip inspection reduces breakdowns and makes minor issues manageable. Keep a minimal kit in the vehicle and adapt for season and terrain.

## Pre-Trip Checks
Quick walkaround + dash scan.

- Tires: Pressure (placard in door jamb), tread depth (≥3 mm/4⁄32" for wet), sidewall damage, valve caps.
- Fluids: Oil, coolant overflow level, washer fluid; look for leaks under vehicle.
- Lights: Headlights, brake, reverse, turn signals, hazards.
- Wipers: Condition and operation; carry spares in harsh climates.
- Dash: Warning lights off? Check engine/service lights noted.

## Belts & Hoses
Inspect for cracks, glazing, fraying; hoses for bulges, soft spots, or leaks. Squeeze radiator hoses (cool engine) — firm, not mushy.

## Tire Health
Use a gauge; inspect tread wear patterns (center wear = overinflated, edges = underinflated, cupping = suspension issues). Verify spare or repair kit readiness.

Tire age
- Find the DOT date code (last 4 digits on sidewall): week and year (e.g., “2319” = 23rd week of 2019). Many manufacturers recommend replacing tires around 6–10 years regardless of tread due to age‑related degradation.
- Check the spare’s age and inflation too; spares often age out unnoticed.

## Lights
Carry a spare bulb/fuse where practical; clean lenses; aim headlights properly.

## Critical Spares
Pack items that fix common issues:

- Tire repair: Plug kit, compact compressor, pressure gauge
- Electrical: Assorted fuses, basic test light
- Fluids: Washer fluid; small oil/coolant top‑off (correct type)
- Tools: Jack, lug wrench, gloves, flashlight, triangle/flares, jumper cables or jump pack
- Seasonal: Blanket, shovel, traction aids (sand, mats), ice scraper, water

☑️ Checklist — Readiness Kit (Basic)
- Tire plug kit + compressor
- Jumper cables or jump pack (charged)
- Triangle/flares/high‑viz vest
- Gloves, flashlight/headlamp, shop towels
- Fuses, basic tools (screwdrivers, pliers, adjustable wrench)
- Fluids: washer, correct oil/coolant
- Blanket, water, snacks (season/region specific)

Examples
- Mountain trip: Increase tire pressure to placard; pack chains if required; add coolant rated for low temps; bring extra washer fluid.
- Summer highway: Check AC belt condition; test spare; pack water and sun protection.

## Key Takeaways
- Ten minutes of checks prevent hours of roadside problems.
- Tires, fluids, and lights are the high‑value items; pack a minimal repair kit.
- Adjust kit and checks for season and terrain.

## Scenario

```
🧭 Scenario (Pre‑trip save): A drywall screw in a rear tire on the walkaround.
🔍 Decisions: Drive anyway vs plug now; compressor ready?
✅ Outcome: You plug the tread, air to placard pressure, and avoid a freeway shoulder change at night.
🧠 Lessons: Five minutes saves hours
🏋️ Drill: Plug a tire on an old carcass or practice on a demo kit.
