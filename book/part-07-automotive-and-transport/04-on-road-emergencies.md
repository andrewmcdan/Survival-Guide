# On-Road Emergencies

## Overview
Stay visible, stabilize the scene, and fix the problem without introducing new hazards. If conditions are unsafe (limited shoulder, poor visibility), call for professional help and prioritize occupant safety away from traffic.

Skill Level: Basic

## Flats
### Jack Points
Use the owner’s manual diagram; typical points are reinforced pinch welds or frame pads. Never crawl under a vehicle supported only by a jack.

### Lug Sequence
Loosen lugs 1/4–1/2 turn in a star pattern before lifting. After wheel on, hand‑tighten in star; torque to spec after lowering.

### Torque
Typical passenger cars: 80–110 ft‑lb—check manual. Re‑torque after 80–100 km (50–60 mi).

### Plug/Patch Kits
For tread punctures (not sidewalls). Remove object, ream hole, insert plug with cement, inflate and check for leaks. Consider as temporary repair.

### Donut Limits
Max ~50 mph (80 km/h) and 50–100 mi (80–160 km) depending on tire. Handling/braking reduced; avoid highways if possible.

## Stuck Vehicle Basics
Clear around tires; lay traction aids (sand, mats, branches); use gentle rocking (forward/reverse) without over‑revving; turn off traction control if manual recommends for rocking.

## Scene Safety
Pull as far off as safely possible; turn wheels away from road; hazards on; high‑viz vest. Place triangles: ~10 m, 100 m behind (adjust for speed/curves).

⚠️ Caution (Power): If using portable generators for scene lighting or pumps at home, never backfeed a building via outlets; use only professionally installed transfer switches. Carbon monoxide kills—run engines outdoors, away from openings.

## Fire Risk Near Fuel Leaks
No smoking/open flame; shut off engine; evacuate downwind and uphill if possible; call emergency services.

☑️ Checklist — Roadside Flat Fix
- Safe location; hazards/triangles; high‑viz on
- Loosen lugs; jack at correct point; wheel chocked
- Swap wheel; star‑pattern tighten; lower; torque
- Stow damaged tire; recheck torque after 80–100 km

Examples
- Night freeway: Triangle placement increased; call roadside; wait behind guardrail if available; only attempt wheel change if fully protected.
- Gravel pullout: Plug tread puncture, inflate to placard pressure, plan shop patch.

## Key Takeaways
- Visibility and scene control first; don’t become a casualty.
- Use proper jack points and star pattern; respect donut limits.
- Plug only tread punctures; patch at shop ASAP.

## Scenario

```
🧭 Scenario (Night flat, tight shoulder): Traffic fast; little room.
🔍 Decisions: Change here vs call; triangle placement; donut limits.
✅ Outcome: You call roadside, place triangles far back, wear high‑viz, and wait behind a barrier.
🧠 Lessons: Visibility and space beat DIY under risk
🏋️ Drill: Practice star‑pattern torque on a safe driveway.
