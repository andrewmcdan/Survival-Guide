# Food

## Overview
Food is long‑horizon. In the first 24–72 hours, safety, shelter, water, and signaling matter more. Still, smart food choices preserve energy, mood, and decision quality. Favor simple, safe, calorie‑dense foods you can eat without elaborate prep.

## Energy Planning
Match intake to effort and environment.

- Daily needs: Light activity 2,000–2,500 kcal; hiking with pack 3,000–4,500 kcal; cold weather adds 10–25%.
- Macro focus: Carbs for quick energy, fats for density/warmth, protein for recovery—balance helps satiety and performance.
- Meal timing: Small, steady intake beats feast/famine. Front‑load before climbs or cold nights.

## Rationing
Preserve energy and morale while extending supplies.

- Inventory: Count meals and snacks; set daily targets; reserve an emergency day if possible.
- Slow‑burn: Nuts, nut butters, bars, jerky, oats; avoid high‑GI binges that crash energy.
- No‑cook options: Bars, nut mixes, tuna packets, tortillas, shelf‑stable spreads; “cold‑soak” oats/couscous if fuel is tight.
- Group: Pool and allocate fairly by effort and need; consider food allergies.

## Safe Foraging Heuristics
Avoid GI hits that can ruin the effort. When in doubt, do not eat it.

- Identification: Only eat what you positively identify via reliable, region‑specific guides or expert instruction.
- Universal edibility tests: Not reliable under field stress—avoid.
- Fungi: High risk of dangerous look‑alikes—avoid unless expert.
- Season/location: Pollution, pesticides, and protected areas make many “edible” things unsafe or illegal.

⚖️ Legal: Foraging laws vary by park/country; many places prohibit plant removal or trapping. Check rules and respect closures.

## Fishing & Trapping (Ethics & Legality)
Focus on safety and legality.

- Observe seasons, licenses, methods, and limits; never poach.
- Safety: Water, hooks, lines, and blades create hazards; manage them deliberately.
- Humane: Quick dispatch, minimal suffering; avoid leaving gear that entangles wildlife.
- Sustainability: Take only what you’ll eat; prefer abundant species.

## GI Risk Avoidance
Prevent illness that drains water and energy.

- Boil risky foods thoroughly; keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold (or eat shelf‑stable).
- Avoid raw/undercooked meats, unpasteurized dairy, or any food from questionable water.
- Hand hygiene: Wash or sanitize before eating/prep; clean knives/boards.
- Storage: Protect from animals/insects; use odor‑control where regulations require.

☑️ Checklist — 72‑Hour Food Kit (No‑Cook Bias)
- Dense: Nuts, nut butters, trail mix, energy bars
- Protein: Jerky, tuna/salmon pouches, shelf‑stable beans
- Carbs: Tortillas, instant oats/couscous (cold‑soakable)
- Flavor/morale: Electrolyte powder, bouillon, chocolate/tea/coffee sachets
- Utensils: Spoon, small knife; zip bags; sanitizer wipes

Examples
- Get‑home bag (24–36 h): 2,500–3,000 kcal of no‑cook foods; 2× electrolyte packets/day; cold‑soak oats overnight.
- Storm shelter‑in‑place (48–72 h): Pantry cans (beans, soups, tuna), crackers, nut butters; rotate stock every 6–12 months.

Narrative — The No‑Cook Menu That Worked
Dinner didn’t need a flame. You laid out tortillas, tuna packets, and a squeeze of mayo—one plate, no heat. Oats cold‑soaked in a jar with a pinch of salt and a handful of raisins sat on the counter for morning. Mid‑day was trail mix and a square of chocolate. It wasn’t glamorous, but no pot needed washing and the stove fuel was still full when the lights blinked back on.

## Key Takeaways
- In the short term, avoid GI risks and choose low‑effort, high‑return foods.
- Plan calories by activity and temperature; ration fairly; keep morale foods.
- Follow laws and ethics for any foraging/fishing; when in doubt, skip it.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (No‑cook 48 h): Power out; you shelter in place.
