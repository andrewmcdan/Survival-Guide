# Purification

## Overview
Use a multi‑barrier approach: pre‑filter to remove sediment, then disinfect by boiling, chemicals, UV, or filtering to an appropriate pore size. No single method is perfect for all threats; choose based on source and context.

## Boiling
Robust and widely effective for microbes.

- Bring water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute. At elevations above 2,000 m / 6,500 ft, boil for 3 minutes.
- Let cool naturally; protect from re‑contamination (pour into clean, covered container).
- Fuel cost: High. Plan fuel budget; boil larger batches to save time.

📝 Note: Boiling inactivates bacteria, viruses, and protozoa (including Giardia and Cryptosporidium) but does not remove chemicals/heavy metals.

## Chemical Disinfection
Fast, light, and works well on clear water. Less effective in very cold or turbid water; extend contact time.

Unscented household bleach (sodium hypochlorite)
- Strength varies. Common: 6% or 8.25%.
- Clear water: 2 drops/L (about 8 drops/gal) for 6%; 1–2 drops/L (6 drops/gal) for 8.25%.
- Cloudy water: Double the dose. Mix well; wait 30 minutes; a slight chlorine smell should be present. If not, add the same dose again and wait 15 more minutes.

Chlorine dioxide tablets/drops
- Effective against bacteria, viruses, and Giardia; needs up to 4 hours for Cryptosporidium (follow manufacturer directions).
- Better taste than bleach; works over a wider pH range.

Iodine (tincture or tablets)
- Clear water: typically 5 drops/L of 2% tincture (or per tablet instructions); 30 minutes contact; double dose/time for cold/cloudy.
- Avoid in pregnancy, thyroid disease, or prolonged use; poor efficacy against Cryptosporidium.

⚠️ Caution: Chemical methods require clear water. Pre‑filter turbid water and extend contact times in cold conditions.

## Filters
Mechanical removal of pathogens and particulates.

- Pore size: 0.1–0.2 µm hollow fiber filters remove bacteria and protozoa (Giardia/Crypto). They do not remove viruses; use a purifier (adds virus barrier) or follow with chemicals/UV when viral risk exists (crowded camps, floods).
- Carbon: Improves taste/odor; reduces some chemicals; does not “purify” alone.
- Freezing: Don’t use if a hollow fiber filter has frozen; internal fibers may crack (invisible failure).
- Maintenance: Backflush as instructed; protect from biofilm growth; store dry when possible.

## UV Pens
DNA/RNA disruption in clear water.

- Use only with low‑turbidity water (pre‑filter first). Stir per instructions to cover all sides; treat container mouth threads.
- Battery dependent; cold reduces output—keep warm in a pocket.
- Repeat the cycle for larger volumes or cold water.

## Solar Disinfection (SODIS)
Passive, low‑resource method for sunny conditions.

- Use clear PET bottles (≤2 L), fill with clear water; place on reflective surface in full sun for 6 hours (or 2 consecutive sunny days in partial cloud). Shake to oxygenate before exposure.
- Works best in equatorial/sunny climates; unreliable in high latitudes/winter.

## Field-Expedient Containers
Improvise when standard containers fail.

- Rigid: Bottles/cans; remove sharp edges; boil only in metal containers.
- Flexible: Heavy freezer bags can hold treated water; double‑bag for redundancy.
- Liners: Clean food‑grade liners inside non‑potable shells (e.g., a trash can) to transport water.

## Pre-Filtering
Reduce turbidity before disinfection.

- Cloth: Bandana/coffee filter to remove large particles.
- Settle: Let water sit; decant the clearer top layer.
- Improvised sand/charcoal column: Layer cloth → sand → cloth → crushed charcoal → cloth. Run water slowly; then disinfect chemically or by boiling.

☑️ Checklist — Multi‑Barrier Treatment
- Source assessed; no chemical sheen/odor; cyanobacteria avoided
- Pre‑filter cloth/settling for turbid water
- Choose method: boil (fuel), filter (pore size), chemical (time), UV (clarity)
- Protect from re‑contamination (clean container, lids)
- Mark treated vs untreated containers clearly

Examples
- Snowmelt camp: Melt and boil large batch; store in covered, clean bottles; avoid eating snow directly.
- Murky desert pool: Settle overnight, decant, filter (0.1 µm), add chlorine dioxide; wait full Crypto time.
- Post‑flood urban: Prefer bottled/packaged water. If none, filter + activated carbon + chlorine; avoid water with chemical odors.

## Key Takeaways
- Combine steps: pre‑filter + disinfect. Match the method to the threat profile.
- Boiling is broadly effective but fuel‑intensive; filters don’t remove viruses; chemicals need clear water and time.
- Prevent re‑contamination by separating clean/dirty gear and labeling containers.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Desert pool, murky): Sun drops in 90 minutes.
> 🔍 Decisions: Boil muddy water vs settle/filter/chemical.
> ✅ Outcome: You settle, decant, cloth pre‑filter, filter 0.1 µm, then chlorine dioxide for Crypto overnight; you sip your reserve with salt while waiting.
> 🧠 Lessons: Multi‑barrier tailored to turbidity
> 🏋️ Drill: Time how much clearer water gets after 30 minutes of settling.
