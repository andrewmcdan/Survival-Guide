# Hydration & Dehydration

## Overview
Dehydration quietly erodes judgment, strength, and thermoregulation. Plan intake, watch for early signs, and treat with measured fluids and electrolytes. Balance against the risks of hyponatremia (too much plain water) and heat illness.

## Signs and Stages
Recognize progression early to prevent spirals.

- Mild (1–2% body weight loss): Thirst, dry mouth, darker urine, mild headache, decreased focus, irritability.
- Moderate (3–6%): Dizziness, fatigue, rapid pulse, reduced sweat/urine, cramps, poor decisions, nausea.
- Severe (≥7%): Very dark/no urine, confusion, fainting, cold clammy skin or hot dry skin, rapid breathing, shock—medical emergency.

📝 Note: Urine color is a rough guide. Aim for pale straw. Some vitamins/foods alter color—don’t rely on color alone.

## Oral Rehydration
Replace fluids steadily; avoid chugging.

- Volume: As a guide, 400–800 mL per hour during exertion in heat; less in cool/calm conditions. Adjust to thirst and urine output; avoid over‑drinking.
- Temperature: Cool fluids (~15–20°C / 59–68°F) are absorbed well and aid cooling in heat.
- Sips > gulps: Take frequent small drinks; add electrolytes when sweating heavily.

⛑️ First Aid: If vomiting, try 5–10 mL every 2–3 minutes; escalate if unable to keep fluids or if mental status worsens.

## Electrolytes
Sodium and potassium help retain water and support muscle/nerve function.

- Practical sources: Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), broths, a mix of water + food + a pinch of salt, commercial electrolyte powders.
- Sports drinks: Often strong—consider 1:1 with water. Avoid very sugary mixes when nauseated.
- Food: Crackers, soups, nuts, and fruits complement fluids.

⚠️ Caution: Hyponatremia (too much water, too little salt) mimics heat illness—headache, nausea, confusion, swelling. Favor ORS or salty snacks with water during heavy sweating.

## Heat Illness Link
Hydration, rest, and cooling break the progression.

- Heat cramps → Heat exhaustion → Heat stroke.
- Heat exhaustion: Heavy sweating, weakness, nausea, dizziness, headache; pulse fast, skin cool/clammy. Move to shade, cool with water/evaporation, give ORS, rest.
- Heat stroke (emergency): Altered mental status, hot skin (may be dry or still sweating), core temp high. Call EMS. Cool aggressively: shade, douse with water, fan vigorously; ice to neck/groin/armpits.

☑️ Checklist — Daily Hydration Plan
- Start hydrated (drink with breakfast)
- Carry known volumes; track intake (marks on bottle)
- Add electrolytes for sustained sweat or heat
- Set hourly sip reminders; check urine at breaks
- Adjust pace/shade/rest by conditions

## ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) Recipe
For 1 liter of safe water:

- 6 level teaspoons sugar
- 1/2 level teaspoon salt
- Mix until fully dissolved. Taste should be “not too salty.”

📝 Notes
- Use level measurements; too much salt can be dangerous, too much sugar can worsen diarrhea.
- Alternatives: Commercial ORS packets; sports drink diluted 1:1 with water; broth + water + crackers if that’s all you have.

Examples
- Hot trail day: Sip 500 mL/h with a light electrolyte mix; 10‑minute shade rests each hour; cool hat and neck.
- GI illness: Use ORS sips 5–10 mL every 2–3 minutes; escalate if lethargy, no urine 6–8 h, bloody stools, or severe dehydration signs.

## Key Takeaways
- Plan hydration and electrolyte intake; avoid both dehydration and over‑hydration.
- Use ORS proportions precisely; small, steady sips beat chugging when ill.
- Treat heat illness early with shade, cooling, and ORS; call for help with stroke signs.
