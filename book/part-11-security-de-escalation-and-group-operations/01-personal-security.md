# Personal Security

## Overview
Most security problems are avoided with posture, choices, and distance. Set boundaries early, use your voice, and leave when things feel off. Your goal is to get home safe, not to win arguments.

## Avoidance
Choose routes and behaviors that reduce exposure.

- Well‑lit routes; avoid predictable routines; travel with others when possible.
- Keep valuables out of sight; minimize phone use while walking.

## Boundary Setting
Use clear, firm statements and maintain distance. “Stop. I don’t want any trouble. I’m leaving.”

## Verbal De-Escalation
Calm voice; non‑confrontational language; acknowledge feelings without agreeing; offer exits. Avoid insults or threats.

## Travel Posture
Confident walk; shoulders down; scan 120°; remove earbud in one ear; keys accessible; bag cross‑body.

## Noise/Light/Odor Discipline
At night or in shared spaces, reduce signatures to avoid attention.

## Common Street Scams & Pretexts
- “Got a light/pen?”: Respectfully decline, maintain distance, keep moving.
- “Can you help carry this?”: Decline if alone; offer to call assistance instead.
- “Uniform” without ID: Ask for ID; keep distance; verify via official phone numbers.

## Vehicle Entry/Exit Safety
- Approach with keys ready; scan around/under vehicle; unlock once, get in, lock immediately.
- Park nose‑out where possible; choose lit areas; avoid being boxed in.
- If bumped lightly from behind in a suspicious area/time, consider driving to a lit, populated place before stopping.

## If You’re Followed
- Change pace/route; cross the street; enter a busy, well‑lit store or transit hub; ask staff for help.
- Call a trusted contact on speaker; share live location; describe the person/vehicle.

## Tech Aids
- Set emergency SOS/shortcut on your phone; pre‑configure emergency contacts.
- Share ETA and live location when walking alone; use a code word with family for “pick me up now.”

☑️ Checklist — Street Smarts
- Route chosen for light/people/visibility
- Phone away; earbuds low/one ear
- Boundaries rehearsed; exit options known
- Keep distance; cross street early if needed

Examples — Boundary Scripts
- “Stop. I don’t want any trouble. I’m leaving.”
- “I can’t help you. Please give me space.”
- “I’m not interested. Have a good night.”

Examples
- Late train stop: Choose busier exit; walk near edges of groups; keep 2–3 m from others; call check‑in when safe.
- Unwanted approach: Verbal boundary; change direction to well‑lit store; call a friend on speaker.
