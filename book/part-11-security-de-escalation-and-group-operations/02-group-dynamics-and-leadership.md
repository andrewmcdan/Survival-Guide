# Group Dynamics & Leadership

## Overview
Small groups succeed with clarity, cadence, and care. Define roles, keep comms short and closed‑loop, and protect rest and morale.

## Roles
Assign who does what.

- Leader (can rotate): decides and coordinates
- Navigator: route/time checks
- Medic: first aid kit, status checks
- Comms: radio/phone, logs

## Check-Ins
Schedule brief check‑ins (e.g., every 30–60 min or at landmarks). Confirm location, status, and intent.

## Span of Control
Keep sub‑groups small (3–5 per lead) to avoid overload; use buddy pairs.

## Morale & Rest Cycles
Rotate heavy tasks; enforce short rests/snacks/water; check for cold/heat stress.

## Briefs & Debriefs
Brief: Purpose, key tasks, end state, hazards, comms. Debrief: What went well, what to change, actions.

## Logs & Task Boards
Whiteboard/notebook for tasks, owners, status. Timestamp decisions.

☑️ Checklist — Group Cadence
- Roles assigned; buddy pairs in place
- Check‑ins scheduled; closed‑loop comms enforced
- Rest/food/water cycles set; morale monitored
- Brief → execute → debrief loop active

Examples
- Trail team: Navigator calls 30‑min checks; Comms logs times/locations; Medic runs warmth checks; Leader sets turnaround time.
- Neighborhood cleanup: Task board with assignments; radio check at top‑of‑hour; 10‑minute rests every hour.
