# Group Dynamics & Leadership

## Overview
Small groups succeed with clarity, cadence, and care. Define roles, keep comms short and closed‑loop, and protect rest and morale.

## Roles
Assign who does what.

- Leader (can rotate): decides and coordinates
- Navigator: route/time checks
- Medic: first aid kit, status checks
- Comms: radio/phone, logs

## Check-Ins
Schedule brief check‑ins (e.g., every 30–60 min or at landmarks). Confirm location, status, and intent.

## Span of Control
Keep sub‑groups small (3–5 per lead) to avoid overload; use buddy pairs.

## Morale & Rest Cycles
Rotate heavy tasks; enforce short rests/snacks/water; check for cold/heat stress.

## Briefs & Debriefs
Brief: Purpose, key tasks, end state, hazards, comms. Debrief: What went well, what to change, actions.

## Logs & Task Boards
Whiteboard/notebook for tasks, owners, status. Timestamp decisions.

## Decision-Making & Comms Patterns
- Closed‑loop: Sender states task; receiver repeats back; sender confirms. Avoid “copy?” without read‑back.
- 1‑3‑1: Present 1 situation, 3 options, 1 recommendation to speed decisions.
- Brief format (lightweight SMEAC): Situation → Mission → Execution (who/what/when) → Admin/Log → Comms.

## Conflict & De‑Escalation Inside Teams
- Name tensions early; use short, neutral language: “Let’s pause. We have two views. We’ll pick one in 60 seconds.”
- Separate people from problem; assign a timebox; pick a plan and move; debrief later.
- Default to safety/energy preservation when in doubt; avoid ego or sunk‑cost fights under fatigue.

## Hand Signals (Noisy/Low‑Light)
- Stop: Raised fist.
- Gather: Arm up, slow circle.
- Move/Advance: Flat hand forward, push motion.
- Slow/Quiet: Palm down, patting motion.
- Point: Two taps on chest, then point to your destination/interest.

☑️ Checklist — Group Cadence
- Roles assigned; buddy pairs in place
- Check‑ins scheduled; closed‑loop comms enforced
- Rest/food/water cycles set; morale monitored
- Brief → execute → debrief loop active

Examples — Comms Scripts
- Tasking: “Alex, take Sam. Clear the east trail to the bend. Report back in 10 minutes.”
- Read‑back: “Copy: Sam and I clear east trail to bend, back in 10.”
- Turnaround: “Weather closing. Turn at 14:30 no matter where we are.”

Examples
- Trail team: Navigator calls 30‑min checks; Comms logs times/locations; Medic runs warmth checks; Leader sets turnaround time.
- Neighborhood cleanup: Task board with assignments; radio check at top‑of‑hour; 10‑minute rests every hour.

## Key Takeaways
- Clear roles and simple cadence prevent confusion.
- Closed‑loop comms and short check‑ins keep teams aligned.
- Rest cycles and morale checks prevent quiet failures.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Trail team cadence): Four hikers, changing weather.
> 🔍 Decisions: Who leads; check‑in schedule; turnaround time.
> ✅ Outcome: You assign roles, run 30‑minute checks, and turn at the planned time, beating the storm.
> 🧠 Lessons: Roles + cadence prevent quiet failures
> 🏋️ Drill: Run a 15‑minute “brief → execute → debrief” on a small task today.
