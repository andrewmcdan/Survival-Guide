# Community Coordination

## Overview
Neighbors are your fastest mutual aid network. Simple structures (check‑ins, roles, radios) turn chaos into coordinated help. Keep it light; build trust.

## Neighborhood Check-Ins
Block captains; door‑to‑door checks for vulnerable residents; share status boards.

## CERT Concepts
CERT trains volunteers in light search/rescue, triage, and fire suppression. Consider training and exercises.

## ICS Basics (Roles, Comms)
ICS provides a common structure: Incident Commander, Operations, Planning, Logistics, Finance/Admin. Use scaled‑down versions for community efforts.

## Mutual Aid Etiquette
Offer within capacity; accept help graciously; communicate limits; document tasks and hazards; don’t self‑deploy into other neighborhoods without invitation/coordination.

## Information Hygiene
Verify before sharing; cite sources; avoid amplifying rumors; monitor official channels; correct mistakes publicly.

## Neighborhood Ops Center (Lightweight)
Pick a predictable spot (lobby, cul‑de‑sac, community room) to post updates and run quick briefs.

- Board: Whiteboard or door sheet with columns: Time, Situation, Tasks, Owners, Status, Needs.
- Signage: Simple arrows to the board; multilingual if needed; clear quiet hours.
- Safety: First‑aid kit, extinguisher, PPE; keep aisles clear; post emergency numbers.
- Brief cadence: Top‑of‑hour 5‑minute huddles. One lead, timeboxed decisions.

## Door Tags & Wellness Checks
Fast visual triage of households without intruding.

- Door tags: Slip simple cards or tape paper: “OK” (no urgent needs) / “HELP” (urgent). Add optional notes (pets, meds).
- Knock script: “Hi, I’m Pat from next door. We’re doing quick checks. Is anyone hurt? Do you need anything urgent?”
- Record: Mark the status board with addresses, time, and any follow‑ups.

## Radio Net & Message Flow (ICS‑Lite)
Run a neighborhood net at set times on a known channel (see PACE plan).

- Net control script: “Neighborhood Net, this is Net Control on FRS 2, time 1800. Check in with address, status, and needs. Over.”
- Check‑in format: “123 Oak: OK, two adults, one child, no needs; have chainsaw; next check 2000.”
- Message form (short ICS‑213): TO, FROM, TIME, MESSAGE, ACTION TAKEN. Snap a photo and post to the board after read‑back.

## Resource Pods
Stage tools and supplies where they’re needed and tracked.

- Pods: Saw + fuel + PPE; tarp + ties + poles; water filter + containers; shovel + salt/sand.
- Sign‑out: Who took what, when, return time; avoids duplication and loss; improves accountability.

## Privacy & Dignity
Share only what’s needed to coordinate tasks. Avoid posting medical details publicly; use “contact Pat in 2B” instead of sensitive notes.

☑️ Checklist — Block Readiness
- Contact list; roles; check‑in schedule
- Simple channel plan (FRS/GMRS) and message board
- Map of residents, skills, resources, vulnerabilities
- Drill quarterly; after‑action notes

Examples — Narrative
The lobby became your ops center. A handwritten sign pointed to a table with a whiteboard: Time, Situation, Tasks, Owners, Status. At 18:00, you ran a five‑minute brief. “Tree down on Maple, power likely overnight. We’ll check on oxygen users, post ‘OK/HELP’ door tags, and set a radio net at 20:00.”
By 18:30, a quiet knock routine covered the third floor. Most doors showed “OK”; one “HELP” note led to a battery bank delivery for a CPAP. Tools lived in labeled tubs—saws with chaps and eye pro in one, tarps and line in another. A simple sign‑out sheet stopped the fourth duplicate broom run.

Examples
- Storm prep: Text tree confirm; radios on Ch 2 at top‑of‑hour; collect needs/offerings list; assign snow/branch clearing teams.
- Outage: Share extension cord etiquette; warming/cooling centers list; check on oxygen‑dependent neighbors.

## Key Takeaways
- Light structure beats chaos; keep it simple and humane.
- Train with CERT if available; borrow ICS concepts as needed.
- Verify information; share only what you’d stake your name on.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Text tree in outage): Power out; rumors fly.
> 🔍 Decisions: Which info to share; channel/time; roles.
> ✅ Outcome: You run hourly check‑ins on FRS Ch 2, post a simple board in the lobby, and squash a false evacuation rumor.
> 🧠 Lessons: ICS‑lite + verification prevents chaos
> 🏋️ Drill: Make a one‑page block plan with channels/times.
