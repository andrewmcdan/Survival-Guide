# Community Coordination

## Overview
Neighbors are your fastest mutual aid network. Simple structures (check‑ins, roles, radios) turn chaos into coordinated help. Keep it light; build trust.

## Neighborhood Check-Ins
Block captains; door‑to‑door checks for vulnerable residents; share status boards.

## CERT Concepts
CERT trains volunteers in light search/rescue, triage, and fire suppression. Consider training and exercises.

## ICS Basics (Roles, Comms)
ICS provides a common structure: Incident Commander, Operations, Planning, Logistics, Finance/Admin. Use scaled‑down versions for community efforts.

## Mutual Aid Etiquette
Offer within capacity; accept help graciously; communicate limits; document tasks and hazards; don’t self‑deploy into other neighborhoods without invitation/coordination.

## Information Hygiene
Verify before sharing; cite sources; avoid amplifying rumors; monitor official channels; correct mistakes publicly.

☑️ Checklist — Block Readiness
- Contact list; roles; check‑in schedule
- Simple channel plan (FRS/GMRS) and message board
- Map of residents, skills, resources, vulnerabilities
- Drill quarterly; after‑action notes

Examples
- Storm prep: Text tree confirm; radios on Ch 2 at top‑of‑hour; collect needs/offerings list; assign snow/branch clearing teams.
- Outage: Share extension cord etiquette; warming/cooling centers list; check on oxygen‑dependent neighbors.

## Key Takeaways
- Light structure beats chaos; keep it simple and humane.
- Train with CERT if available; borrow ICS concepts as needed.
- Verify information; share only what you’d stake your name on.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Text tree in outage): Power out; rumors fly.
> 🔍 Decisions: Which info to share; channel/time; roles.
> ✅ Outcome: You run hourly check‑ins on FRS Ch 2, post a simple board in the lobby, and squash a false evacuation rumor.
> 🧠 Lessons: ICS‑lite + verification prevents chaos
> 🏋️ Drill: Make a one‑page block plan with channels/times.
