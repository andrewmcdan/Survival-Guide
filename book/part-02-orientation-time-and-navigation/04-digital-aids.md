# Digital Aids (as available)

## Overview
Phones and handheld GPS units are outstanding—until batteries die, apps crash, or signals fail. Treat digital tools as accelerators for good fundamentals, not replacements. Preload what you need and run a battery‑aware plan.

## Offline Map Prep
Do this at home on Wi‑Fi before travel.

- Download offline map tiles for your whole area plus alternates (city + surrounding region or trail system + exits).
- Layers: Topo, satellite, and vector road maps. Add slope/aspect/hazard layers if supported.
- Waypoints: Trailheads, shelters, water sources, bail‑out routes, rendezvous spots, hospitals.
- Tracks/Routes: Pre‑load your intended route and likely detours.

📝 Note: Verify that your app shows coordinates and allows manual entry even when offline and out of service.

## GPS Accuracy Caveats
Know when your dot lies to you.

- Multipath: Signals bounce off rock/steel → position jumps; expect in canyons and cities.
- Canopy: Dense trees reduce satellites in view; track drifts, speed misreports.
- Urban canyons: Tall buildings block/reflect signals; expect large errors.
- Device factors: Cold batteries, wet screens, and low sky visibility degrade accuracy.

⚠️ Caution: When the track looks “too smooth” under canopy or “jittery” in a canyon, trust map + compass + terrain association first.

## Battery Discipline
Stretch runtime without sacrificing safety.

- Duty cycle: Screen off; check position on a schedule (e.g., every 15–30 minutes or at decision points).
- Power settings: Airplane mode; enable only GPS; lower screen brightness; disable background app refresh.
- Cold: Keep device and power bank warm (inside jacket). Lithium loses output in cold.
- Cables: Use short, quality cables; secure against strain.

💡 Tip: Carry a small paper map or a screenshot of the area with critical notes as a zero‑battery fallback.

## Waypoint Shorthand
Name things so you can parse them at a glance.

- Prefix type: TH=Trailhead, W=Water, S=Shelter, A=Attack point, B=Backstop, R=Rendezvous, H=Hospital.
- Include essentials: Name, brief note, elevation, access notes (e.g., “W‑Creek clean, filter; summer only”).
- Timestamp critical drops and cache notes.

## Coordinate Formats
Understand and standardize what you use with your group.

- Lat/Long (WGS84):
  - Decimal degrees: 37.7749°, −122.4194° (fast typing; beware ±)
  - Degrees/minutes: 37°46.5' N, 122°25.2' W (common in marine/aviation)
- UTM: Zone + easting + northing in meters; easy for distance math on maps with grid.
- MGRS: Military grid; compact; good for voice comms once trained.

📝 Note: Pick one default for your team; include datum (usually WGS84). Add the other formats to your quick card for translation.

## Quick Conversion Cards
Make a pocket card for your kit and share a photo with your team.

- Declination value and update year for your region
- Coordinate format examples and how to switch in your app/GPS
- Pace counts for 100 m (flat/trail/rough)
- Emergency contact numbers and PACE comms plan times/channels

☑️ Checklist — Digital Nav Readiness
- Offline maps + layers downloaded
- Key waypoints and routes/alternates set
- Declination noted; map/grid preference aligned with group
- Battery plan: power bank, cable, warm carry method
- Paper fallback (printed or screenshot with notes)

Examples
- Weekend hike: Offline topo + satellite; TH/Water/Shelter/Rendezvous waypoints; 30‑minute duty cycle; paper map in zip bag.
- Urban evac drill: City vector map offline; hospitals and gas stations marked; SMS check‑ins hourly; phone in low‑power mode.

## Key Takeaways
- Digital tools are fast and powerful, but you must plan for failure modes.
- Pre‑load maps and waypoints; standardize coordinate formats within the group.
- Duty cycle location checks and protect batteries from cold; carry a paper fallback.
