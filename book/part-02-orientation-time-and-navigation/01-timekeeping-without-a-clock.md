# Timekeeping Without a Clock

## Overview
When electronics fail or you conserve battery, you still need rough timing for safety: knowing when to turn back, when the sun will set, and how long tasks will take. Use the sky, your steps, and simple improvised timers to keep your plan on schedule.

## Sun Shadow Stick
Use the sun’s predictable motion to measure time and direction.

Setup (flat ground):
- Place a straight stick (0.5–1 m) upright in the ground.
- Mark the tip of the shadow with a small stone (Mark A). Wait 15–30 minutes.
- Mark the new tip location (Mark B). Draw a line from A to B—this line points roughly west (A) to east (B) in the northern hemisphere; reverse in the southern hemisphere.

Estimating time:
- The sun moves ~15° per hour across the sky. The shadow tip moves steadily. After calibrating once (see below), you can estimate minutes passed by the shadow’s progress between marks.

Calibration: On a day when you know the time, mark the tip every 10 minutes for 1 hour and label the marks. Re‑use that spacing as a mental model later.

📝 Note: Near the equator and around solar noon, shadow movement slows or shortens; expect less precision.

## Sun Arc Heuristics
Crude but quick estimates by sun position.

- “Fist rule”: At arm’s length, the vertical width of your fist ≈ 10–15° ≈ ~40–60 minutes of sky travel. Count fist‑widths between sun and horizon to estimate time until sunset.
- Seasonal caveat: High latitudes and seasons (summer/winter) change sun height; be conservative.

💡 Tip: Combine with a set turnaround time (e.g., “Two fists to sunset → stop forward progress now and set shelter”).

## Star “Clock” Basics
Use the rotation of a star pattern around the celestial pole to estimate hours at night.

Northern hemisphere (Big Dipper/Polaris):
- Find the Big Dipper. Draw a line through the two outer bowl stars to Polaris (North Star). Imagine a clock with Polaris at the center and the Dipper as the hour hand.
- The Dipper rotates counter‑clockwise ~360° per 23h56m (~15°/h). If the Dipper is “on the horizon” at the 9 o’clock position and later “above” at 12 o’clock, roughly 3 hours passed.

Southern hemisphere (Crux/Southern Cross):
- Extend the long axis of Crux ~4.5 times to find the south celestial pole (SCP). Use the rotation of the Cross around the SCP as your “hour hand.” It rotates clockwise ~15°/h.

⚠️ Caution: Cloud, light pollution, and seasonal star positions reduce accuracy. Treat as coarse estimates (±1–2 h).

## Moon Phase Hints
The moon’s rise/set times shift with phase. Useful for rough planning.

- New moon: Not visible; rises/sets with the sun (dark nights).
- First quarter (half‑moon lit on the right in N. hemisphere): Rises around noon; sets around midnight.
- Full moon: Rises at sunset; sets at sunrise (good night light).
- Last quarter (half‑moon lit on the left in N. hemisphere): Rises around midnight; sets around noon.

📝 Note: Times vary by location and season; use these as cues, not precise clocks.

## Pacing & Time-on-Task Estimates
Convert distance into time using your pace under current conditions.

Calibrate pace (flat ground):
- Measure 100 m. Count steps for 100 m (each time your left foot hits is one count). Do 3 trials; average them. That’s your “100 m pace.”
- Track distance with pace beads: 1 bead per 100 m (10 beads = 1 km). Reset each kilometer.

Time formula (rough): time (min) ≈ distance (km) ÷ speed (km/h) × 60.

Speed guidelines (on foot, with pack):
- Easy trail: 3–4 km/h; broken/steep: 1–2 km/h; bushwhack/snow: 0.5–1.5 km/h.

Adjustments:
- Add 10–20% for elevation gain, heat, snow, or heavy load.
- Subtract 10–20% if on road/track with light load.

☑️ Checklist — Time Discipline
- Set a hard turnaround time (leave 25–35% of daylight for return/setup).
- Log start times at trailheads and key decision points.
- Re‑estimate ETA every 30–60 minutes (OODA loop) and when conditions change.

## Makeshift Hourglasses & Drips
Simple timers from common items.

Water drip:
- Puncture a tiny hole in a bottle cap; fill bottle; measure how long it takes to drain a known volume (e.g., 50 mL). Mark the bottle with intervals.

Sand/soil hourglass:
- Two bottles/cans with a taped center hole; dry sand flows more consistently than water in freezing temps.

🧰 Gear: A small alcohol‑based hand sanitizer separates wet sand; carry a paperclip/needle to make or clear holes.

## Key Takeaways
- Use the sun for both direction and time; calibrate a shadow stick once to build intuition.
- At night, star rotation offers very coarse hours—combine with pacing and scheduled check‑ins.
- Pace beads and conservative speed estimates prevent late shelters and night travel surprises.
- Always set a turnaround time; arriving early is free safety.
