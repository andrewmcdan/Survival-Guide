# Map, Compass & Dead Reckoning

## Overview
Navigation is a chain: orient the map, choose a line, follow it with a compass and terrain features, and keep track of distance and time. Use redundant methods—if one link breaks, the others keep you honest.

## Bearings
Two common tasks: ground→map and map→ground.

Ground to map (resection)
- Sight a landmark with your compass; note the magnetic bearing.
- Add declination to convert to a true bearing (see Declination). Subtract 180° (back‑bearing) to project from the landmark toward you.
- Draw that line on the map through the landmark. Repeat with a second landmark; the intersection ≈ your position.

Map to ground
- On the map, draw a line from your position to your target; read the true bearing.
- Convert true→magnetic by subtracting declination (east positive; west negative). Set that bearing on your compass and follow it by sighting a distant feature; walk to it; repeat.

Back‑bearing to check drift
- If following a bearing, turn around and check the bearing is ±180° from your set course (mod 360°). Large differences signal drift or interference.

## Declination
Magnetic north ≠ true north. Declination is the angular difference (east positive, west negative) between them at your location.

Simple conversions
- Magnetic → True: True = Magnetic + Declination
- True → Magnetic: Magnetic = True − Declination

Examples
- Declination = +12° (east). Magnetic 70° → True 82°. True 250° → Magnetic 238°.
- Declination = −8° (west). Magnetic 70° → True 62°. True 250° → Magnetic 258°.

⚠️ Caution: Know whether your compass has adjustable declination. If it’s set in the baseplate, don’t do math twice.
📝 Note: Declination shifts over time. Check your local value annually and update your compass/baseplate notes; many topo maps show the year and annual change.
⚠️ Caution: Keep compasses away from ferrous metal, vehicles, and phones when taking bearings. Step 3–5 m away, level the compass, and re‑check to avoid magnetic interference.

## Triangulation
Fix your position by intersecting lines from two (ideally three) known points.

Two‑point resection (compass method)
- Pick two distinct landmarks visible to you and identifiable on the map (peaks, towers).
- Take magnetic bearings to each; convert to true; subtract 180° to form back‑bearings.
- Draw both back‑bearings from the landmarks; the intersection is your position (or a small triangle—your error zone).

Three‑feature resection (map method)
- Align map to terrain (orient map using compass and terrain features).
- Identify three features around you; draw rays toward them along your sight lines. Intersection area is your position.

## Pace Count Beads
Track distance accurately without electronics.

Setup
- Know your 100 m pace on flat, trail, and rough terrain (calibrate as in Timekeeping Without a Clock).
- Beads: Ten lower beads (each = 100 m) and four upper beads (each = 1 km). After 10 lowers, slide one upper and reset lower beads.

Usage
- Slide one lower bead each 100 m; at 1 km, reset lowers and slide one upper.
- Record terrain changes and bearing checks at each kilometer in a small log.

💡 Tip: Quick time estimate with Naismith’s Rule (on foot): ~1 hour per 5 km plus ~1 hour per 600 m of ascent (adjust for load, terrain, and fitness).

## Terrain Association
Use visible features to confirm your location constantly.

- Contours: Ridges, saddles, spurs, reentrants—match their shape and spacing to the map.
- Water: Streams, lakes, marshes—note flow direction and confluences.
- Man‑made: Roads, powerlines, buildings—use as handrails or backstops.

## Handrails
Follow nearby linear features that run roughly along your desired direction.

- Natural: Rivers, shorelines, ridgelines.
- Man‑made: Roads, fences, pipelines.
- Offset technique: Intentionally aim to one side of a handrail (attack point) so you know which way to turn when you hit it.

## Backstops
Pick an obvious feature beyond your target so you know when you’ve gone too far.

- Examples: A road crossing the trail, a stream bend, a cliff line.
- Set a time/distance backstop too (e.g., “If not there in 30 minutes, turn back”).

## Attack Points
Navigate first to an easy, nearby feature, then make a short, precise leg to the target.

- Example: Reach a stream–trail junction (attack point), then follow a 310° bearing for 400 m to a campsite.

☑️ Checklist — Simple Nav Plan
- Start/known point and time logged
- Target and attack point defined
- Bearing(s) and declination noted (true and magnetic)
- Distance (pace beads) and time estimate
- Handrails/backstops identified
- Contingency if off‑course (stop, resection, or return to last known point)

Examples
- Low‑viz forest: Handrail along a stream (flowing N→S), attack point at a distinctive bend, then 600 m on 085° magnetic to a cabin.
- Open terrain: Follow a fence line (handrail) 1.2 km, then use a 200 m 270° leg to a tank. Backstop is the cross‑fence beyond.

## Key Takeaways
- Convert bearings correctly; write both true and magnetic to avoid mental math in the field.
- Use handrails and attack points to reduce error; set backstops to prevent overshoot.
- Keep a running log of bearings, distances, and times; it’s your breadcrumb trail.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Whiteout timberline): Trail vanishes; you can see two distinct peaks briefly through clouds.
> 🔍 Decisions: Wander vs resection; write bearings or keep in head.
> ✅ Outcome: You take two magnetic bearings, convert to true, draw back‑bearings, and fix position in a small triangle; you choose a handrail to a shelter.
> 🧠 Lessons: Resection > wandering; write both true/mag
> 🏋️ Drill: Do a two‑point resection at a city park.
