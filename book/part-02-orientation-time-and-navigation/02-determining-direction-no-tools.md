# Determining Direction (No Tools)

## Overview
When you lack a compass, direction still comes from the sun, stars, and terrain. Use several cues together to reduce error. If cues conflict, stop and reassess rather than forcing a bad bearing.

## Sun Methods
Use shadows and the sun’s daily path.

Shadow tip method (quick east–west line):
- Place a stick upright; mark the tip of its shadow (Mark A). Wait 15–30 minutes; mark again (Mark B).
- Draw a line A→B: in the northern hemisphere, A→B ≈ west→east; in the southern hemisphere, A→B ≈ east→west. Perpendicular to this line gives north–south.

Morning/evening heuristic:
- Morning: Sun is roughly in the east; shadows point roughly west. Evening: reverse.

⚠️ Caution: High latitudes and seasonal daylight changes reduce accuracy. Verify with at least one other cue.

## Polaris (Northern Hemisphere)
Find true north at night.

- Find the Big Dipper (Ursa Major). Draw a line through the two outer bowl stars ~5× their spacing to a moderately bright star: Polaris.
- Polaris sits close to true north (within ~1°). Face Polaris → you face north; east is right, west is left, south is behind you.
- Polaris altitude above the horizon ≈ your latitude (useful for rough location awareness).

📝 Note: Visual cue — The two outer bowl stars of the Big Dipper “point” about five times their spacing to Polaris (true north).

## Southern Cross (Southern Hemisphere)
Find true south at night.

- Locate Crux (Southern Cross). Extend the long axis of the Cross ~4.5× to the south celestial pole (SCP).
- From the SCP, drop a line straight down to the horizon—that point is true south.
- Alpha and Beta Centauri (“the Pointers”) can help verify the long axis orientation.

📝 Note: Visual cue — Extend the long axis of the Southern Cross ~4.5× to estimate the south celestial pole, then drop to the horizon for true south.

## Local Cues
Terrain and ecology sometimes hint direction. Treat as supporting, not primary.

- Prevailing winds shape snow cornices and sand ripples; leeward sides show deposition.
- Tree growth: In exposed areas, trees may be stunted or flagged on the windward side.
- Aspect: In many regions, south‑facing slopes (N. hemisphere) are warmer/drier; north‑facing are cooler/damper (reverse in S. hemisphere).
- Urban: Street grid orientation, satellite dishes often point toward equator (south in N. hemisphere, north in S.).

## Lichen Myths vs Realities
“Moss grows on the north side of trees” is unreliable.

- Moisture, shade, and local wind patterns—not cardinal direction—govern moss/lichen.
- In ravines, near water, or shaded urban areas, growth can be on all sides.

📝 Note: Use biological cues only as a low‑confidence tie‑breaker alongside celestial or map cues.

☑️ Checklist — No‑Tools Direction
- Try for at least two independent cues (e.g., sun shadow + terrain aspect).
- Draw a quick ground sketch with your east–west and north–south lines.
- Mark your intended direction of travel and a backstop if you overshoot.
- Re‑check at set intervals or after 15–20 minutes of travel.

Examples
- Mid‑day, broken clouds: Build a shadow stick line, then pick a perpendicular line for north–south; choose a landmark along your bearing.
- Night, southern hemisphere: Use the Southern Cross long axis to find SCP, drop to horizon for south; set a landmark and walk to it, then pick the next.

## Key Takeaways
- Prefer celestial methods for cardinal directions; verify with terrain cues.
- Set visual “attack points” along your line to reduce drift over distance.
- If cues conflict, stop (STOP), rebuild the picture (OODA), and choose anew.

## Scenarios

> 🧭 Scenario (Desert noon): The sun is high, shadows short. Wind carries sand from the west.
> 🔍 Decisions: Trust wind cue vs build a shadow stick; pick a landmark.
> ✅ Outcome: You build a quick A→B shadow line for east–west, choose a distant butte on your bearing, and walk leg‑to‑leg.
> 🧠 Lessons: Two cues beat one; pick attack points
> 🏋️ Drill: Practice shadow‑line in 20 minutes.

> 🧭 Scenario (Southern hemisphere night): You find the Southern Cross.
> 🔍 Decisions: Which way is south? Which landmark to pick?
> ✅ Outcome: Extend Crux, drop to horizon for south; you mark a dune and travel to it deliberately.
> 🧠 Lessons: Hemisphere‑specific methods matter
> 🏋️ Drill: Sketch Crux→SCP method from memory.
