# Cordage & Knots

## Overview
A small set of knots solves most field problems: securing loads, building shelters, and creating adjustable lines. Practice until you can tie them in the dark and under stress.

## Square Knot
Join same‑diameter lines; not for critical loads. Right over left, left over right. Secure with backups or use a sheet bend instead.

## Bowline
Fixed loop that doesn’t slip. “Rabbit comes out of the hole, around the tree, back into the hole.” Leave a long tail; secure with a stopper (Yosemite finish optional).

## Clove Hitch
Quick midline/anchor tie‑off. May slip on slick lines or with changing loads; back up with a half hitch.

## Constrictor Knot
Excellent binding knot; holds tight, difficult to release—use when you can cut free later.

## Taut-Line Hitch
Adjustable friction hitch for guylines. Two wraps toward the anchor, one away; slides to tension, holds under load.

## Trucker’s Hitch
Creates ~2:1 mechanical advantage to cinch loads/tarps. Anchor → loop (slip knot) → through anchor → back to loop → pull tight → finish with half hitches.

## Sheet Bend
Join lines of unequal diameter; more secure than square knot. Add a second turn (double sheet bend) for slippery lines.

## Prusik
Slides when slack, grabs when loaded. Cord ~60–80% of rope diameter; 2–3 wraps common. Use for emergency progress capture or adjustable loops.

## Lashings
Square for right‑angle frames; diagonal to stabilize crossed spars; shear to make folding bipods. Finish with frapping turns to cinch tight.

## Improvised Harness/Drag
Seat harness from webbing (water knot to join ends); tarp/sled drags for short moves with multiple helpers; watch for spinal concerns.

## Simple 3:1 Z-Drag (Caution)
For light recovery only with proper anchors and pulleys. High forces build quickly; use gloves, clear zones, and real rescue training for human loads.

☑️ Checklist — Shelter Tension Lines
- Bowline on tarp grommet; trucker’s hitch to anchor
- Taut‑line on stakes for adjustability
- Backup slippery hitches; check after wind gusts

Examples
- Tarp A‑frame: Bowlines at corners; ridge with trucker’s hitch; guylines with taut‑lines; clove hitch + backup to poles.
- Load tie‑down: Trucker’s hitch to cinch, finish with two half hitches; inspect after first mile.

## Key Takeaways
- Practice a core set: bowline, trucker’s hitch, taut‑line, sheet bend, clove, constrictor, prusik.
- Back up slippery/simple hitches; inspect under load.
- Use appropriate cord/rope sizes; avoid shock loading improvised systems.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Storm tarp holds): Wind shifts at 02:00.
> 🔍 Decisions: Re‑tie corners; add trucker’s hitch; adjust taut‑lines.
> ✅ Outcome: You tighten guylines with trucker’s hitches, reset taut‑lines, and sleep through the squall.
> 🧠 Lessons: Bowline + trucker’s + taut‑line = shelter toolkit
> 🏋️ Drill: Tie these three knots in under 60 seconds, eyes closed.
