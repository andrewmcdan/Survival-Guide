# EDC, Get-Home, and 72-Hour Kits

## Overview
Pack by layers—not by fantasy. Everyday Carry (EDC) stays on you; the Get‑Home Bag (GHB) lives where you are during the day; the 72‑Hour Kit covers short disruptions. Tune for season, climate, and your realistic scenarios.

## Layered Loadouts
Person, bag, vehicle, home.

- Person (EDC): ID, phone, small light, whistle, small multitool/knife (legal), bandanna, basic first aid (bandages), cash (small bills), key PACE plan.
- Get‑Home Bag (12–24 h): Water, filter, electrolytes, snacks, weather layer, hat/gloves, socks, small first aid/bleeding control, headlamp, map/compass, cordage, tape, battery bank, mask, simple tools.
- Vehicle: Readiness kit (tire, jump, fluids), blanket, water, extra food, triangles/high‑viz, paper maps.
- Home (72‑hour): Water (4 L/person/day), shelf‑stable food, stove/fuel, light/lanterns, batteries, charger/inverter, sanitation, meds, tools, radio.

## Seasonal Variations
Cold: Insulation layers, beanie, gloves, hand warmers, emergency bivy, de‑icer. Hot: Electrolytes, sun protection, brim hat, lightweight long sleeves, foot care kit.

## Weight/Benefit Math
Choose items you’ll actually carry. Favor multi‑use gear; cut dead weight.

☑️ Checklist — GHB Basics (~6–9 lb / 3–4 kg)
- Water 1–2 L + filter or tabs; electrolyte packets
- Food 1,500–2,500 kcal no‑cook
- Clothing: insulation, rain shell, socks, hat/gloves (seasonal)
- Navigation: map, compass, pen/paper; local transit map
- Light: headlamp + spare batteries
- First aid: bandages, blister kit, gloves; bleeding control if trained
- Tools: multitool, tape, 10–15 m cordage, lighter/ferro rod
- Comms: battery bank + cable; PACE card; small radio if used

Examples
- Office commuter: Slim GHB under desk with shoes, socks, map, food/water, light jacket, battery bank; quarterly refresh.
- Rural driver: Vehicle kit emphasized—water, blankets, traction aids, shovel, paper maps, extra fuel if safe/legal.

- Keep PACE card and local maps in each layer.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Office evac walk): Transit down, 14 km home.
> 🔍 Decisions: Shoes vs dress flats; water; route; weight.
> ✅ Outcome: You change to trail runners and socks from the GHB, sip steadily, and walk a safe route in 3 hours.
> 🧠 Lessons: Weight you carry is the kit you use
> 🏋️ Drill: Weigh your GHB and try a 5 km loop.
