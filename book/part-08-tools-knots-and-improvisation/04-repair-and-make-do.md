# Repair & Make-Do

## Overview
Improvisation keeps you moving. A small repair kit and a few techniques can fix gear, seal leaks, and create tools. Think: tape + wire + needle + adhesive.

## Tape
Duct (general), medical (skin/splints), electrical (insulation), Tenacious/repair (fabrics/tents). Fold “tabs” on ends for gloved use.

## Wire
Soft steel or baling wire binds, splints, and secures. Deburr ends; avoid skin punctures; tape sharp twists.

## Sewing
Sail/curved needles + heavy polyester thread; backstitch for strength; add patches with contact adhesive + stitching.

## Epoxy
Two‑part putty fills cracks, rebuilds threads; cures even when damp (check product). Roughen surfaces; clamp while curing.

## Bottle & Can Hacks
Cut bottles into funnels/scoops; cans into windshields/pot stands (deburr edges); foil as reflector.

## Reflectors & Containers
Space blanket as signal or radiant barrier; nested bags/liners to store water; label clean vs dirty.

## Zippers, Buckles, and Straps
- Zipper slider pinch: Many “broken” zips are loose sliders. Pinch the slider gently with pliers to restore grip on teeth; replace lost pulls with cord.
- Buckles: Carry spare side‑release buckles that thread onto existing webbing; field‑replace broken pack buckles without sewing.
- Webbing repairs: Bar‑tack by hand (tight back‑and‑forth stitches) or fold‑over and stitch through with heavy thread; reinforce with tape until home fix.

## Footwear Patches
- Sole peel: Clean/dry; contact cement both sides; wait until tacky; press and clamp overnight.
- Laces: Replace with paracord inner strands in a pinch; tape lace tips to form aglets.

## Adhesives & Cure Windows
Contact cements (e.g., Barge) need time: apply thin coats to both surfaces, wait until tacky, then press. Epoxies vary—carry the label or note cure times.

☑️ Checklist — Micro Repair Kit
- 2 m heavy tape (flat‑packed), 2 m electrical tape
- Baling wire or twist ties; zip ties assortment
- Heavy needle + strong thread; small sail needle; safety pins
- 2‑part epoxy putty; small tube contact cement
- Spare buckles/webbing; patches; sandpaper scrap

Narrative — The Strap That Didn’t End the Trip
Halfway up the trail, your pack’s hip‑belt buckle snapped on a rock. The trip wasn’t over. You threaded a field‑replaceable buckle onto the webbing, pinched a stubborn zipper slider back to life on a pocket, and wrapped a frayed strap end with tape to stop the creep. Ten minutes later you were moving again—with notes to order real parts at home.

Examples
- Tent pole crack: Splint with tent stake and tape; reinforce with wire; plan replacement.
- Leaky bottle: Dry thoroughly; patch with tape + adhesive; use as non‑potable container.

## Key Takeaways
- Tape + wire + needle + epoxy fix most field failures.
- Deburr and reinforce; label containers as clean/dirty.
- Flat‑pack supplies to fit every kit layer.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Tent pole snap): Wind cracks a pole at camp.
> 🔍 Decisions: Pack up vs splint; materials.
> ✅ Outcome: You sleeve with a stake, tape tight, add wire wrap, and finish the trip.
> 🧠 Lessons: Tape + wire + spare stake = portable sleeve
> 🏋️ Drill: Pre‑pack a flat tape roll and short wire wrap.
