# Repair & Make-Do

## Overview
Improvisation keeps you moving. A small repair kit and a few techniques can fix gear, seal leaks, and create tools. Think: tape + wire + needle + adhesive.

## Tape
Duct (general), medical (skin/splints), electrical (insulation), Tenacious/repair (fabrics/tents). Fold “tabs” on ends for gloved use.

## Wire
Soft steel or baling wire binds, splints, and secures. Deburr ends; avoid skin punctures; tape sharp twists.

## Sewing
Sail/curved needles + heavy polyester thread; backstitch for strength; add patches with contact adhesive + stitching.

## Epoxy
Two‑part putty fills cracks, rebuilds threads; cures even when damp (check product). Roughen surfaces; clamp while curing.

## Bottle & Can Hacks
Cut bottles into funnels/scoops; cans into windshields/pot stands (deburr edges); foil as reflector.

## Reflectors & Containers
Space blanket as signal or radiant barrier; nested bags/liners to store water; label clean vs dirty.

☑️ Checklist — Micro Repair Kit
- 2 m heavy tape (flat‑packed), 2 m electrical tape
- Baling wire or twist ties; zip ties assortment
- Heavy needle + strong thread; small sail needle; safety pins
- 2‑part epoxy putty; small tube contact cement
