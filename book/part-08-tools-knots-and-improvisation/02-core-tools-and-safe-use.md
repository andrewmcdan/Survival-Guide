# Core Tools & Safe Use

## Overview
Tools save time and energy when used deliberately. The best tool is the one you can use safely under stress. Keep edges sharp, grips secure, and work areas controlled.

## Knife
Grips, cuts, and care.

- Grips: Hammer (power), pinch (control). Keep your off‑hand behind the edge.
- Cuts: Cut away from body; use chest‑lever cuts and supported carving for control.
- Surface: Cut on stable surfaces; baton only with appropriate tang/steel and safe technique.
- Care: Dry, clean, oil lightly; sharpen regularly.

## Multitool
Use pliers for hot pots, wire, and small fixes; fold tools properly. Beware pinch points.

## Saw
Pull strokes do the work; let the saw cut—don’t force. Wedge kerfs to prevent binding; clear the cut path.

## Blade Care
Carry a small sharpener; touch up often. Lubricate pivots; store dry.

## PPE
Gloves, eye protection, sturdy shoes. Tie back hair; avoid loose clothing.

## Sharps Discipline
Announce “knife” when passing; sheath when not in use; set a blood bubble (arm’s reach safety zone).

☑️ Checklist — Tool Safety
- Stable stance and surface
- PPE on; blood bubble clear
- Cut away; control blade path; keep off‑hand safe
- Sheath/tools stowed after use

Examples
- Fire prep: Feather sticks with chest‑lever cuts; saw branches with wedged kerf; no batoning on rocky ground.
- Food prep: Dedicated clean knife and board; sanitize after raw meats.

## Key Takeaways
- Sharp + controlled beats dull + forceful.
- PPE and discipline prevent most injuries.
- Maintain tools; small, frequent sharpening avoids big repairs.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Saw bind avoided): Limb under load; saw starts to pinch.
> 🔍 Decisions: Force vs wedge; change cut; PPE.
> ✅ Outcome: You wedge the kerf, change the angle, and finish safely.
> 🧠 Lessons: Let the saw cut; wedge binds
> 🏋️ Drill: Practice kerf wedging on scrap wood.
