# Radios (Brief, Practical)

## Overview
Radios connect teams when phones fail. Keep it simple: pick legal services for your region, standardize channels and tones, and practice concise, clear exchanges. Height beats power; line‑of‑sight matters.

## FRS/GMRS Basics
Know your service and its limits (U.S. examples—verify your country’s rules).

- FRS (Family Radio Service): No license; fixed antennas; low power (0.5–2 W depending on channel); typical range 0.5–2 mi on foot.
- GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service): License required in U.S.; higher power (up to 50 W mobile); detachable antennas; can use repeaters.
- “Privacy codes”: CTCSS/DCS sub‑audible tones reduce nuisance traffic but do not secure your comms.

FRS power and channels (U.S. summary)
- Ch 8–14: 0.5 W max
- Ch 1–7, 15–22: up to 2 W (fixed antennas only)

GMRS repeater quick note (U.S.)
- Repeaters typically listen on 467.x MHz and transmit on 462.x MHz with a tone. If legal and available, program the output channel, input (with +5 MHz), and correct tone per repeater info.

Weather alerts (SAME)
- Weather radios can filter alerts to your county via SAME codes. Look up and program your local SAME codes; keep a printed card with county names/codes in your kit.

Range reality
- Open ridge to ridge: many miles. Forest/urban clutter: hundreds of meters to a few km. Inside buildings: highly variable.

## Line-of-Sight
Radios are mostly line‑of‑sight at these frequencies.

- Gain height: Move uphill, hold radios upright; avoid standing behind vehicles/rock walls.
- Obstructions: Buildings, terrain, and wet foliage absorb/reflect signals.
- Human body: Don’t block the antenna with your hand; keep it vertical.

## Simple Antennas
For services that allow it, antennas yield the biggest improvement per dollar.

- Handhelds: A 1/2‑wave whip often outperforms short “rubber ducks.”
- Mobiles: Roof‑mounted quarter‑wave whips with good ground plane.
- Position: Get the antenna above head height; extend fully; keep vertical.

## Channel Discipline
Be brief, clear, and predictable.

- Call format: “You–This is–Me–On–Channel” (e.g., “Base, this is HikerOne on three.”)
- Keep it short: Who/Where/What/Intent. Avoid chatter.
- Prowords: “Say again” (repeat), “Standby” (wait), “Affirmative/Negative,” “Wilco” (will comply), “Break” (separate thoughts), “Out” (end).
- Phonetics: Use NATO phonetic alphabet; numbers spoken individually when clarity matters.
- Check‑ins: On the hour and half‑hour or by plan; acknowledge with status.

## PACE Comms Plan
Write it down and carry it.

- Primary: e.g., GMRS Ch 3, tone 0.
- Alternate: FRS Ch 1, tone 0.
- Contingency: Text on the hour; leave written note at trail junction.
- Emergency: Meet at “North Lot 19:00”; PLB/SOS for life threats only.

☑️ Checklist — Radio Op Quickstart
- Radio on correct channel/tone; volume set
- Antenna vertical; move to high, clear spot
- Press‑to‑talk: press, pause 1 second, speak; release fully
- Use WHO/WHERE/WHAT/INTENT; confirm with readback
- Log key messages (time, content, decisions)

Examples
- Search rendezvous: “Base, HikerOne: At Saddle Junction 14:10, all okay, intent continue south to Creek, next check‑in 15:00, over.”
- Urban family check: “FamilyNet, Alex: Home 18:20, power out, intent stay, next 20:00, out.”

⚖️ Legal: Licensing and permitted power/antennas vary by country and service. Follow local regulations. Do not transmit on emergency or restricted channels unless directed or in true emergency per law.

## Key Takeaways
- Height and antenna quality often matter more than raw power.
- Standardize channels, tones, and message format; schedule check‑ins.
- Keep transmissions short and clear; confirm with readbacks.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Neighborhood after storm): Power out, cell congested. Family and two neighbors check in on FRS Ch 2.
> 🔍 Decisions: Check‑in cadence; message format; who logs.
> ✅ Outcome: You run top‑of‑hour check‑ins with WHO/WHERE/WHEN/WHAT/INTENT; readbacks confirm; you log decisions.
> 🧠 Lessons: Cadence + format + readbacks = clarity
> 🏋️ Drill: Do a 10‑minute radio net with prowords at home.
