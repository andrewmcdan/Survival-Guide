# Electronic Signals

## Overview
Electronics extend your range and precision. Use them in an escalation ladder: low‑power options first, then higher‑commitment tools like satellite messengers and PLBs for emergencies. Conserve batteries and keep clear sky view.

## Strobes
High‑visibility, attention‑getting flashes for night or low‑viz.

- Modes: Steady, slow strobe, fast strobe; choose slow/medium for readability at distance.
- Placement: On your person (head/shoulder) or at a fixed, visible point; avoid blinding teammates or drivers.
- Pairings: Combine with whistle or radio call‑ins on a schedule.

## Chem Lights
Simple, durable, battery‑free markers.

- Colors: Green (general), red (reduced night vision impact), blue/white (visibility); note that color meaning varies—brief your group.
- Duration vs brightness: 8–12 h typical; colder temps dim output. Warm with hands for better brightness.
- Uses: Mark camps/trails, identify people/gear, “buzz‑saw” on string for sky circles to attract attention.

## Personal Locator Beacons (PLB)
Gold standard for life‑threatening emergencies with no comms.

- How they work: 406 MHz signal to satellites; registered beacon ties to your info; 121.5 MHz homing signal for local search.
- Registration: Required; keep contact info current. No subscription; battery service life ~5–7 years.
- Activation: Clear sky view; extend antenna; turn on and leave on. Stay put unless in immediate danger.
- Testing: Use built‑in test mode only; do not trigger a live SOS for practice.

⚠️ Caution: PLB is for imminent, life‑threatening emergencies only. False activations can endanger responders and carry penalties.

## Satellite Messengers
Two‑way (e.g., inReach) or one‑way (e.g., SPOT) devices bridge the gap between phones and PLBs.

- Presets: Pre‑program “OK,” “Delayed but safe,” “Need pickup at X” to send quickly with minimal battery.
- Tracking: Breadcrumbs at set intervals; helpful for family and rescue routing.
- SOS: For serious emergencies; responders may message for details on two‑way units.
- Sky view: Keep device with clear view; clip to shoulder strap; avoid deep canyons when possible.

## Phone Emergency Features
Phones are versatile when coverage exists or for local offline tasks.

- SOS: Configure emergency SOS and emergency contacts; practice the activation gesture (varies by phone).
- Medical ID: Add allergies, meds, conditions for first responders.
- Offline: Store maps, checklists, and notes locally; use airplane mode + GPS for nav when possible.
- SMS first: Texts often get through congested networks when calls fail.

☑️ Checklist — Electronic Signal Escalation
- Try low‑power first: SMS, scheduled texts, and local radio call‑ins
- Move to higher reach: voice calls, then satellite messenger presets
- Life‑threatening emergency: activate PLB/SOS and stay put if safe
- Keep sky view, conserve battery, and document last known location/time

Examples
- Backcountry injury: No cell; send preset “Injured, non‑amb, at UTM 10S 0551234 4321987, sheltering; need evac at daylight” via inReach; start 30‑min strobe; conserve battery.
- Coastal kayak: Weather worsening; send “Delayed but safe, landing at ALT beach” preset; activate white strobe on PFD; hold VHF watch if licensed and applicable.

## Key Takeaways
- Escalate signaling deliberately: SMS → voice/radio → sat messenger → PLB for life threats.
- Keep devices warm and with sky view; duty‑cycle checks; carry paper backups.
- Pre‑program presets and contacts so signaling under stress is one‑button simple.
