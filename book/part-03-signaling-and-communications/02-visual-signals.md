# Visual Signals

## Overview
Visual signals scale from tiny flashes to giant ground symbols. Think contrast, size, and motion. Day favors smoke, color, and mirrors; night favors flame and light. Choose safe, open areas and prepare multiple methods.

Skill Level: Basic

## Fires
Fire can attract attention but adds risk. Use only where safe and permitted.

- Day: Aim for smoke contrast. Dry fuel = light/whitish smoke; damp green vegetation can add volume and darker smoke—avoid plastics/rubber (toxic, illegal in many areas).
- Night: Flame triangles or lines are visible from far away; maintain safely.
- Structure: Clear a safe ring to mineral soil; keep water/dirt on hand; never leave unattended.

⚠️ Caution: Wildfire risk and local bans may prohibit open flames. Choose mirrors/panels instead when conditions are risky.

## Mirrors & Shiny Objects
Mirrors can project bright flashes visible miles away in sunlight.

- Sighting: Hold mirror near eye; form a “V” with two fingers as a sight; move the bright spot (reflected on your hand) onto the target.
- Sighting hole mirrors: Look through the hole; aim the bright reticle (sunspot) at your target.
- Improvised: Polished metal, foil, CD, phone screen (remove case, max brightness if using screen).

💡 Tip: Sweep slowly across the horizon where you expect rescuers (trail, road, waterway, flight path).

## Ground-to-Air Panels
Large, high‑contrast letters or symbols laid on the ground.

- Materials: Bright tarps, space blankets (dull side up to avoid glare), clothing, foam pads, rocks contrasting with soil/snow.
- Scale: Each stroke ≥ 6–10 m long and 1–3 m wide; wider in open terrain. Keep a 2–5 m “halo” of cleared area around the symbol for maximum contrast.
- Placement: Open areas near handrails (shorelines, ridge clearings, river bends, meadows). Avoid under canopy where aerial visibility is blocked.

💡 Tip: Bright signal panels (e.g., VS‑17 style) and high‑vis tarps are excellent day markers. On water, dye markers or brightly colored fabric spread on the surface can improve contrast.

## Common Ground-to-Air Symbols
Use standard symbols for clarity.

### V — Require Assistance
Lay out three long strokes to form a clear V. Angle open toward expected approach.

### X — Require Medical Assistance
Two long strokes crossing at center. Place near the patient location.

### → / Arrow — Direction of Travel
Long arrow with clear head; point toward your travel direction. Add a number or time beside it if possible (e.g., “14:30”).

### Y / N — Yes / No
Respond to aircraft/ground queries if they signal questions.

### SOS — General Distress
Three big letters; space evenly. Good on beaches, river bars, deserts, or snowfields.

### F / W — Need Food / Water
Place near camp; keep clear surround for maximum contrast.

☑️ Checklist — Quick Panel Build
- Move to open area near a handrail
- Choose symbol with the fewest strokes for speed (V or X)
- Lay out large, straight strokes with high contrast
- Clear debris around the symbol to create a “halo”
- Add arrow/time if moving

Examples
- Snowfield: Tramp out a giant “V” in packed snow; add a dark jacket for contrast.
- Desert wash: Lay a silver space blanket (dull side up) with rocks outlining a large “X.”

## Key Takeaways
- Bigger, higher contrast, and simpler beats fancy. Aim for strokes ≥ 6–10 m.
- Mirrors are high‑payoff in sun; fires require strict safety and may be illegal.
- Panels work best near search handrails and from open vantage points.

## Scenarios

```
🧭 Scenario (Coastal kayak, day): Ferry lane 1 km offshore.
🔍 Decisions: Mirror vs smoke; shoreline V vs open beach.
✅ Outcome: You sweep mirror flashes toward the lane and tramp a giant V on the sand near a headland.
🧠 Lessons: Contrast + movement near handrails = detection
🏋️ Drill: Practice mirror sighting at 500 m.

🧭 Scenario (Snowfield): Helicopter heard faintly.
🔍 Decisions: Symbol choice; stroke length.
✅ Outcome: You stamp a huge X and stand clear; they spot you.
🧠 Lessons: Big, simple, high‑contrast symbols work
🏋️ Drill: Pace out 10 m strokes and memorize the look.
