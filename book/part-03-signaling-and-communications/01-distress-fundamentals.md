# Distress Fundamentals

## Overview
Signaling turns a small group’s senses into the world’s. Your goals are to be seen, heard, or located by rescuers without creating new hazards or exhausting yourself. Use repeated, unmistakable patterns, choose high‐visibility positions, and balance signaling with shelter and first aid.

Skill Level: Basic

## SOS
Internationally recognized pattern: three short, three long, three short.

- Timing (Morse): dot = 1 unit, dash = 3 units; space between dots/dashes = 1; letters = 3; words = 7.
- Mediums: whistle, flashlight, mirror flashes, radio tones, ground panels, or knocks.

Examples
- Flashlight: · · · — — — · · · then pause 10–20 seconds and repeat.
- Mirror: Three quick flashes → three long sweeps → three quick flashes, repeat.

💡 Tip: If Morse is hard under stress, default to the Rule of Three—three of anything, spaced and repeated. It’s widely recognized.

## Rule of Three
Use “three” as the universal distress signature.

- Three whistle blasts, repeated at intervals (e.g., every 1–2 minutes).
- Three flashes of light or mirror sweeps, repeated.
- Three fires in a line or triangle (day: smoke; night: flame glow).

☑️ Checklist — Patterning
- Choose a clear pattern (three of something) and repeat on a schedule.
- Leave listening windows between cycles to detect replies.
- Pair different mediums (sound + light) when possible.

## Whistle Signals
Carry a pea‑less whistle on your person; voice carries poorly when you’re tired or winded.

- Distress: 3 blasts; repeat every 1–2 minutes.
- Where are you?: 1 blast.
- Come to me: 2 blasts.
- Acknowledge/heard: 1 long blast.

📝 Note: Agree signals with your group before departing; write them on your PACE card.

## Shouting
Use your voice sparingly. A whistle is more effective and less exhausting.

- Project from high points or across water; avoid prolonged shouting in cold air (irritates throat, wastes heat).
- Pair with light signals at night and pause to listen for responses.

💡 Tip: Cup hands to focus your voice; call out short words like “HELP” spaced by breaths.

## Gunshots (Legal/Safety)
Use of firearms for signaling is dangerous and restricted in many places. Avoid unless absolutely necessary, legal, and safe.

- If used, space three shots over 1–2 minutes; ensure a safe backstop—never fire into the air; rounds come down unpredictably.
- Hearing safety: protect ears; warn companions.
- ⚖️ Legal: Discharge laws vary. Prefer legal alternatives (whistle, light, radio, PLB).

⚠️ Caution: Fire risk in dry seasons and populated areas; do not signal with firearms where it endangers others.

## Location, Positioning, and Energy Management
Pick a spot where signals will travel and rescuers are likely to search.

- Visibility: Choose open ground, ridgelines (safe from exposure), lake shores, clearings, or near handrails (roads, rivers, trails).
- Contrast: Lay out bright items (tarp/clothing) in geometric patterns; avoid visual clutter.
- Energy: Set a schedule (e.g., signal hard every 10 minutes, rest 5). Protect from cold/heat while signaling.

⛑️ First Aid: Control bleeding and protect from exposure before starting extended signaling. See Survival Priorities → Rule of 3s.

Examples
- Day, broken forest: Move to a small clearing near a stream bend (search handrail); lay out a bright “V” panel; three whistle blasts every 2 minutes; mirror flashes when sun breaks.
- Night, urban outage: Flashlight three short/three long pattern from a balcony; text status to family on the hour; avoid blinding drivers or responders.

## Key Takeaways
- Make it unmistakable: three repeated signals, on a schedule, with listening gaps.
- Prioritize safety: treat life threats and manage exposure before extended signaling.
- Choose positions that maximize detection: contrast, height, proximity to handrails.
- Prefer whistles, lights, panels, and radios/PLBs over hazardous or illegal methods.

## Scenario

```
🧭 Scenario (Temperate forest, lost): Drizzle, late day. You have a whistle and a tiny light.
🔍 Decisions: Shout vs whistle; move vs signal; cadence.
✅ Outcome: You set three whistle blasts every two minutes, sweep your light in ··· ——— ··· when fog thins, and rest between cycles.
🧠 Lessons: Pattern + schedule + listening windows
🏋️ Drill: Practice a 10‑minute signal cycle with rests.
