# Vehicle & Flood Interactions

## Overview
Water hides hazards and multiplies force. Avoid entering flood water on foot or in vehicles. Escape from entrapped vehicles requires speed and a plan.

## Avoiding Water Crossings
Assess depth, speed, and substrate.

- Do not drive through moving water; roadbeds may be washed out.
- Depth: 15–30 cm (6–12 in) can float small cars; 0.6 m (2 ft) can float most vehicles.
- Speed: Fast flows sweep feet/vehicles; seek alternate routes.

## Swiftwater Hazards
Cold shock, debris impact, foot entrapment, and strainers (trees/fences). Do not attempt rope rescues without training; call professionals.

## Vehicle Float/Entrapment Realities
If water rises around a vehicle:

- Unbuckle; children out of seats first; unlock doors; windows down immediately if power works.
- If power fails: Break side windows (not windshield) with a dedicated tool aimed at corners; kick if needed.
- Exit and move to higher ground; don’t waste time on belongings.

Narrative — Seconds Count
Rain hammered so hard the wipers smeared. The underpass ahead looked shallow—until a truck’s wake slapped your bumper. You stopped before the deepest pool, shifted to reverse, and felt the tires lose bite. The door locks clicked. You unbuckled, hit all four window switches. Two slid; two stuttered. You shoved a glass‑break tool into the rear side window corner and popped it with a sharp push. Kids out first—one by one through the opening—then you. Wallet and phone stayed behind. On the sidewalk, you watched taillights disappear under the brown water you didn’t enter.

☑️ Checklist — Flood Safety
- Avoid water crossings; turn around
- Know low‑water/flood‑prone routes and avoid in storms
- Carry glass‑break/seatbelt cutter tool within reach
- If trapped: unbuckle → windows → out → up

Examples
- Urban flash flood: Turn onto higher parallel street; avoid underpasses; delay arrival.
- Low water crossing after storm: Depth unknown; road possibly undermined; wait or reroute.

## Key Takeaways
- Don’t drive/walk through flood waters; roads may not exist under the surface.
- If entrapped, act quickly: seatbelts, windows, exit, higher ground.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Underpass fills fast): Rain bursts; water rises around cars.
> 🔍 Decisions: Proceed vs back out; alternate route.
> ✅ Outcome: You reverse out early and reroute; later you learn cars were stranded.
> 🧠 Lessons: Early retreat beats getting stuck
> 🏋️ Drill: Save an alt route in your map app.
