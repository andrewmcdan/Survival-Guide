# Vehicle & Flood Interactions

## Overview
Water hides hazards and multiplies force. Avoid entering flood water on foot or in vehicles. Escape from entrapped vehicles requires speed and a plan.

## Avoiding Water Crossings
Assess depth, speed, and substrate.

- Do not drive through moving water; roadbeds may be washed out.
- Depth: 15–30 cm (6–12 in) can float small cars; 0.6 m (2 ft) can float most vehicles.
- Speed: Fast flows sweep feet/vehicles; seek alternate routes.

## Swiftwater Hazards
Cold shock, debris impact, foot entrapment, and strainers (trees/fences). Do not attempt rope rescues without training; call professionals.

## Vehicle Float/Entrapment Realities
If water rises around a vehicle:

- Unbuckle; children out of seats first; unlock doors; windows down immediately if power works.
- If power fails: Break side windows (not windshield) with a dedicated tool aimed at corners; kick if needed.
- Exit and move to higher ground; don’t waste time on belongings.

☑️ Checklist — Flood Safety
- Avoid water crossings; turn around
- Know low‑water/flood‑prone routes and avoid in storms
- Carry glass‑break/seatbelt cutter tool within reach
- If trapped: unbuckle → windows → out → up

Examples
- Urban flash flood: Turn onto higher parallel street; avoid underpasses; delay arrival.
- Low water crossing after storm: Depth unknown; road possibly undermined; wait or reroute.

## Key Takeaways
- Don’t drive/walk through flood waters; roads may not exist under the surface.
- If entrapped, act quickly: seatbelts, windows, exit, higher ground.
