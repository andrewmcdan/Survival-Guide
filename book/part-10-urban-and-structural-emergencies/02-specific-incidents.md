# Specific Incidents

## Overview
Incidents differ, but patterns repeat: protect airway and breathing, control heat loss/gain, avoid obvious hazards, and communicate. Use these quick guides, then adapt locally.

## Earthquake
During shaking
- Drop, Cover, Hold On: Get under a sturdy table/desk or beside an interior wall; cover head/neck; hold until shaking stops.
- Stay put: Indoors → stay indoors; outdoors → move to open area away from buildings, glass, power lines.
- In bed: Stay in bed, cover head with pillow; don’t run barefoot over glass.
- In a vehicle: Pull over clear of bridges, overpasses, trees, and wires; stop with brake applied; stay inside until shaking stops.

After shaking
- Check for injuries first; control bleeding; treat life threats.
- Fire/gas/electric: If you smell gas or hear hissing, don’t use switches; open door/window if safe and evacuate; shut gas off only if you suspect a leak (pro must turn it back on).
- Evacuate via stairs; avoid elevators; expect aftershocks; keep shoes on; avoid glass façades.

Common mistakes
- Running outside during shaking; standing in doorways in modern buildings (not safer).
- Turning gas back on yourself; re‑entering damaged structures before inspection.

## Hurricane
Before
- Track forecasts and local orders; know your evacuation zone; leave early if advised.
- Protect: Install shutters/plywood; bring in outdoor items; clear gutters/drains; trim weak branches.
- Prep: Water (at least 3–4 L/person/day), shelf‑stable food, meds, documents, cash; charge devices; fill fuel; freeze water bottles to extend fridge.
- Generator: Run outside only; 6+ m (20 ft) from doors/windows; CO alarm working.

During
- Shelter in an interior room or hallway away from windows; wear shoes; keep helmets for kids.
- Avoid flood rooms; do not enter standing water; unplug non‑essential devices; monitor official alerts.

After
- Beware downed lines, gas leaks, and unstable trees/structures; use gloves and eye protection.
- Avoid floodwater (contaminants, sharp debris); heed boil‑water advisories; document damage safely.

## Tornado
During
- Move to the lowest interior room/basement; small center rooms, under sturdy furniture; cover head/neck (helmets/blankets).
- Mobile homes, vehicles, outdoors: Move to sturdy shelter immediately; do not shelter under overpasses.

If caught outside with no shelter
- Lie flat in a low spot only as a last resort; protect head/neck; watch for flash flooding.

After
- Treat injuries; check for gas leaks; avoid damaged power lines and debris fields.

## Flood
Avoidance
- Turn around, don’t drown: 15–30 cm (6–12 in) of moving water can knock you off your feet; ~0.6 m (2 ft) floats most vehicles.
- Know low spots/underpasses on your routes; pre‑plan higher alternates.

If water rises
- Move to higher ground/floors; avoid basements.
- On foot: Use a stick to probe depth; avoid manholes/drains; avoid fast flows.
- In vehicle: Reverse out early; if trapped, see Vehicle & Flood Interactions.

After
- Assume contamination (fuel/sewage); avoid contact; discard food/water exposed to floodwater; shut power off only if safe/dry.

## Wildfire
Before
- Create defensible space (clear brush/combustibles); have go‑bags, N95/KN95 masks, eye protection; vehicle fueled, nose‑out.
- Pre‑set triggers for leaving (e.g., plume and wind direction, evacuation zone status) and go early.

During
- If ordered or you feel unsafe, leave early; drive with lights on; windows up; A/C on recirculate; watch for embers and low visibility.
- If trapped: Shelter in a cleared area; as last resort stay in vehicle with engine off, doors closed, below window line; cover skin; move only when survivable.

After
- Watch for hotspots, weakened trees, and falling ash; check air quality; wear masks while cleaning.

## Winter Storms
Before
- Weatherize home (insulate, cover outdoor spigots); stage safe heat sources; stock water/food; check CO/smoke alarms; check neighbors.
- Vehicle: Winter tires, chains where legal, car kit (blanket, shovel, traction aids, sand, water, snacks). Keep tank ≥1/2.

During
- Stay inside; layer clothing; use safe heat only; ventilate fuel heaters; never run grills indoors.
- In vehicle: Park safely; clear tailpipe; run engine 10–15 min each hour for heat; crack a downwind window; conserve fuel.

After
- Beware ice fall and hypothermia; shovel carefully (spine/heart risk); rest often; hydrate.

## Heatwaves
Risk management
- Hydrate with electrolytes; schedule activity early/late; use cooling centers; check on vulnerable people (elderly, infants, workers).
- Shade windows; use fans to exhaust hot air at night and draw in cooler air; avoid alcohol; wear light, loose clothing.

Emergencies
- Heat exhaustion: Cool in shade, fluids, rest; remove excess clothing; cool mist and fan.
- Heat stroke (emergency): Altered mental status or collapse—call EMS; cool aggressively (cold water immersion if possible, or douse water + fan); place ice packs at neck/groin/armpits.

## Hazmat/Air Quality Events
Shelter‑in‑place (airborne particulates/irritants)
- Choose an interior room; close/lock windows/doors; turn off HVAC; seal gaps with tape/towels; run HEPA if available.
- N95/KN95 helps for particulates (smoke/dust); they do not protect against gases (e.g., chlorine, ammonia).

DIY room air cleaner (wildfire smoke)
- A simple “Corsi‑Rosenthal box” (4–5 MERV‑13 filters taped into a cube with a box fan on top) can significantly reduce indoor PM2.5. Seal edges with tape; run on low/medium for noise and efficiency; position centrally in the room you occupy most.

Chemical releases
- If you see/smell a chemical cloud, move perpendicular to wind to exit plume; follow official directions promptly.
- Decon basics: Remove outer clothing; bag it; shower with soap and water (not harsh chemicals); avoid spreading contaminant.

## Elevators & Stairwells
Elevators
- If entrapped: Use alarm/phone; call emergency services; stay inside car unless explicitly directed by responders; falls happen when people try to self‑rescue.
- During fire/outage: Do not use; take stairs.

Stairwells
- Use handrails; keep right; avoid bottlenecks; watch smoke—choose a clear stair if possible; close doors behind you to slow smoke.

## Crowd Crush Avoidance
Prevention
- Identify exits on arrival; stay on edges; avoid rigid barriers; monitor density (>4–5 people/m² is dangerous).

If density rises
- Angle diagonally with the flow toward edges; keep arms up in a box around chest to protect breathing space; communicate calmly.

If knocked down
- Curl to protect head/neck; get to knees then feet at first chance; move toward edge; help others up when safe.

## Glass & Facade Hazards
Avoid zones beneath glass curtain walls and façades during wind/seismic events; heed cordons; choose interior corridors; wear sturdy shoes.

Post‑incident
- Beware falling glass, spalled concrete, and unsecured signage; don’t linger under cranes/scaffolding; follow building safety notices.

☑️ Checklist — Urban Incident Basics
- Know two exits per building/venue
- Carry light, whistle, and small first aid on person
- Keep phone charged and offline maps stored
- Agree on family rendezvous and PACE comms
- Respect cordons; avoid glass zones and flood underpasses

Examples
- Flash flood warning: Cancel drive through low‑lying shortcut; use higher route; delay if necessary.
- Post‑quake: Evacuate via stairs; check gas smell; bring go‑bag; text check‑in at rendezvous.

## Key Takeaways
- Pre‑plan exits and rendezvous; leave early when hazards grow.
- SIP for air hazards; evacuate for fire/structural threats.
- Avoid water crossings and glass zones; keep comms and light on person.
- For floods/wildfire/tornado, triggers and early action save lives.
