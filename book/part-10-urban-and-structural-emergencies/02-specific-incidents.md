# Specific Incidents

## Overview
Incidents differ, but patterns repeat: protect airway and breathing, control heat loss/gain, avoid obvious hazards, and communicate. Use these quick guides, then adapt locally.

## Earthquake
Drop, Cover, Hold On. Stay indoors during shaking; away from windows. After shaking, check for fire/gas leaks; use stairs; expect aftershocks.

## Hurricane
Track forecasts; prepare shutters; secure outdoor items; shelter away from windows; evacuate early if in surge/low areas.

## Tornado
Move to lowest interior room/basement; cover head/neck; avoid windows, vehicles, and overpasses. Heed sirens and alerts.

## Flood
Turn around, don’t drown. 15–30 cm (6–12 in) of moving water knocks you off your feet; 0.6 m (2 ft) can move a car. Evacuate vertically if horizontal routes are blocked.

## Wildfire
Watch alerts; prepare go‑bag; clear combustibles; seal against smoke; leave early along pre‑planned routes; drive with lights on.

## Winter Storms
Shelter in place with layers and safe heat; prevent pipe freeze (drip faucets, insulate); avoid travel; pack winter car kit.

## Heatwaves
Hydrate; rest; use cooling centers; check on vulnerable people; avoid peak heat; create cross‑breeze at night when safe.

## Hazmat/Air Quality Events
Shelter‑in‑place; seal room; use HEPA; avoid smoke/chemicals; follow official evacuation orders. Use well‑fitting masks (e.g., N95) for particulates; note masks don’t protect from gases.

## Elevators & Stairwells
Use stairs during fires or outages; never use elevators then. If entrapped, call for help; conserve battery; do not self‑rescue from stuck elevator unless directed.

## Crowd Crush Avoidance
Avoid densities >4–5 people/m²; stay on edges; identify exits on arrival; move diagonally with flow; protect head and chest if knocked down.

## Glass & Facade Hazards
Stay clear of glass curtain walls during wind/seismic events; heed cordons; use interior routes; wear shoes.

☑️ Checklist — Urban Incident Basics
- Know two exits per building/venue
- Carry light, whistle, and small first aid on person
- Keep phone charged and offline maps stored
- Agree on family rendezvous and PACE comms

Examples
- Flash flood warning: Cancel drive through low‑lying shortcut; use higher route; delay if necessary.
- Post‑quake: Evacuate via stairs; check gas smell; bring go‑bag; text check‑in at rendezvous.

## Key Takeaways
- Pre‑plan exits and rendezvous; leave early when hazards grow.
- SIP for air hazards; evacuate for fire/structural threats.
- Avoid water crossings and glass zones; keep comms and light on person.

## Scenarios

> 🧭 Scenario (Flash flood reroute): Underpass pooled with fast water.
> 🔍 Decisions: Push through vs turn around; alt route time.
> ✅ Outcome: You turn, take a higher parallel street, and arrive late but safe.
> 🧠 Lessons: “Turn around, don’t drown” saves lives
> 🏋️ Drill: Identify three low spots on your commute and alternates.

> 🧭 Scenario (Quake aftershock): Stairs or shelter in place?
> 🔍 Decisions: Wait for shaking to stop; check for hazards; exit path.
> ✅ Outcome: You wait, grab go‑bag, avoid glass curtain wall, and descend via stairs to the rally point.
> 🧠 Lessons: Two exits known in advance beat panic
> 🏋️ Drill: Walk two exits for home/work/school.
