# Shelter-in-Place vs Evacuate

## Overview
Decide early and deliberately whether to stay or go. Shelter‑in‑place protects from external hazards; evacuation trades exposure risks for reaching safety. Pre‑plan triggers and routes.

## Decision Triggers
Match triggers to hazards and your circumstances.

- Shelter‑in‑place: Air quality/hazmat outside, civil unrest nearby, severe weather without safe route, mobility limits.
- Evacuate: Fire in building, structural damage, rising water, directed by authorities, downstream of dam/burn scar with heavy rain.

## Utility Shut-Off
Know how to safely shut off utilities.

- Gas: Only if you smell gas or suspect a leak; turn valve 90° to off; only a pro should turn back on.
- Electric: Main breaker off before working on circuits; stand to the side; dry hands.
- Water: Close main to protect supply; open low faucet to drain if needed.

## Ventilation & Smoke Control
For poor air, choose an interior room; seal gaps with tape/towels; run HEPA if power exists. For smoke/fire, close doors to limit spread; stay low; feel doors for heat before opening; use wet cloths only as comfort—not protection.

☑️ Checklist — Stay or Go
- Hazard identified; triggers matched (stay vs go)
- Comms: receive official alerts; family PACE plan confirmed
- If staying: interior room chosen; sealing materials ready; supplies on hand
- If going: go‑bag ready; route known (primary/alternate); shut‑offs as needed

Examples
- Wildfire smoke: SIP in interior room; tape seals; HEPA on; check AQI; leave if evacuation ordered or smoke intrudes.
- Apartment fire alarm: Feel door; if cool, exit via stairs with keys/ID; if hot/smoky, stay inside, seal, signal from window.

## Key Takeaways
- Decide early; SIP for outside air hazards, evacuate for internal fire/structural threats.
- Know shut‑off procedures; never re‑light gas yourself.
- Keep a go‑bag and a room‑sealing kit ready.

## Scenarios

```
🧭 Scenario (Apartment smoke in hall): Alarm sounds; door feels cool.
🔍 Decisions: SIP vs stairs; materials to seal; keys.
✅ Outcome: You gather keys, phone, go‑bag; crack door cautiously; stairwell is clear; you evacuate. If smoke, you’d seal and signal.
🧠 Lessons: Door control + pre‑staged kit
🏋️ Drill: Time your grab‑and‑go to the stair door.
