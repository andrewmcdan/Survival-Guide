# Fire Behavior Basics

## Overview
Fire grows with fuel, heat, and oxygen. Control doors and ventilation to starve fire of oxygen and heat flow. Smoke kills—stay low, move fast, and have a plan.

## Flow Path Awareness
Openings create paths for hot gases and smoke.

- Closing doors slows fire spread; isolates smoke/heat.
- Opening windows/doors feeds fire and can draw flames—only ventilate to escape.

## Door Control
Feel door with back of hand; if hot, do not open. If cool, open slowly, staying behind the door; close doors behind you during egress.

Reading smoke and gaps
- Smoke layer: If smoke banks down to the floor, conditions are deteriorating—stay very low or choose another exit.
- Door gap/hinge side: A strong inward draw at gaps can indicate fire pulling air from your side; opening can feed it. Keep doors closed to starve fire and consider alternate routes.
- Cloth over mouth/nose may reduce irritation but does not filter toxic gases (CO/HCN); do not rely on it for safety.

## Stay-Low Movement
Crawl or stay low; smoke rises. Keep one hand on wall; count doors in smoke; follow landmarks.

## Egress Planning
Know two exits from every room; practice family escape; keep keys near egress; don’t block exits with storage.

☑️ Checklist — Home Fire Prep
- Smoke/CO alarms tested monthly; batteries fresh
- Extinguishers accessible; know PASS (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep)
- Two exits per room; meeting point outside
- Close doors at night; clear egress paths

Examples
- Kitchen fire: Lid on pan; turn off heat; don’t move flaming pan; small extinguisher if safe; evacuate if out of control.
- Apartment smoke in hall: Close your door; seal gaps; call for help; signal at window; evacuate only if safe.

## Key Takeaways
- Control doors and vents; smoke/heat flow follows openings.
- Staying low and closing doors saves lives.
- Practice escape routes; alarms and extinguishers ready.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Closed‑door survivability): Night fire on another floor.
> 🔍 Decisions: Door closed vs open; stay or go; window signal.
> ✅ Outcome: You keep the door closed, seal gaps, signal at the window, and survive until firefighters arrive.
> 🧠 Lessons: Close before you doze; door control saves lives
> 🏋️ Drill: Close bedroom doors nightly.
