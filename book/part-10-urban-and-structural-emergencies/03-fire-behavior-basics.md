# Fire Behavior Basics

## Overview
Fire grows with fuel, heat, and oxygen. Control doors and ventilation to starve fire of oxygen and heat flow. Smoke kills‚Äîstay low, move fast, and have a plan.

## Flow Path Awareness
Openings create paths for hot gases and smoke.

- Closing doors slows fire spread; isolates smoke/heat.
- Opening windows/doors feeds fire and can draw flames‚Äîonly ventilate to escape.

## Door Control
Feel door with back of hand; if hot, do not open. If cool, open slowly, staying behind the door; close doors behind you during egress.

## Stay-Low Movement
Crawl or stay low; smoke rises. Keep one hand on wall; count doors in smoke; follow landmarks.

## Egress Planning
Know two exits from every room; practice family escape; keep keys near egress; don‚Äôt block exits with storage.

‚òëÔ∏è Checklist ‚Äî Home Fire Prep
- Smoke/CO alarms tested monthly; batteries fresh
- Extinguishers accessible; know PASS (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep)
- Two exits per room; meeting point outside
- Close doors at night; clear egress paths

Examples
- Kitchen fire: Lid on pan; turn off heat; don‚Äôt move flaming pan; small extinguisher if safe; evacuate if out of control.
- Apartment smoke in hall: Close your door; seal gaps; call for help; signal at window; evacuate only if safe.
