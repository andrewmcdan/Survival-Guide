# Pets, Kids & Dependent Care

## Overview
Evacuations succeed when dependents’ needs are pre‑planned. Keep essential care items ready, transport safely, and document needs clearly.

## Car Seats During Evacuation
Use correct seat type and installation.

- Keep seats installed and ready; practice rapid transfer between vehicles.
- Use lower anchors or seat belts per manual; check harness chest clip at armpit level.

## Pet Carriers
Sized for animal to stand/turn/lie. Label with name/owner/contact; include leash, muzzle (if needed), water, and pad.

## Medications
Maintain 7–14 day supply if possible; rotate. Keep printed list: names, doses, schedules, prescribers, allergies. Store backups in go‑bag.

## Documentation
IDs for kids/pets; copies of medical cards, vaccination records, and care instructions; emergency contacts; consent for caregivers.

## Mobility & Medical Devices
- Mobility aids: Keep spares/repair kits for wheelchairs, walkers, and canes; plan accessible routes and loading.
- Powered medical devices: Identify battery needs and runtime (CPAP, oxygen concentrators); stage backup power (fully charged banks/inverters) and charging plan; register with local utility/authority medical baseline programs where available.

☑️ Checklist — Dependent Evac Ready
- Car seats staged; practice installation
- Pet carrier with ID, leash, water; plan for hotels/shelters that accept pets
- Meds list + labeled weekly sorter; refills tracked
- Copies of IDs, insurance, contacts; caregiver consent forms

Examples
- Wildfire evac: Kids buckled with go‑bags; pet carriers pre‑loaded; meds and documents folder grabbed; rendezvous confirmed.
- Flood sheltering: Hotel pre‑screened for pets; spare litter and food packed; medications with cold‑pack.
