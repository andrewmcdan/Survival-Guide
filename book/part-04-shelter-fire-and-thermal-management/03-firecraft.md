# Firecraft

## Overview
Fire provides heat, light, morale, drying power, signaling, and disinfection—but it also consumes time and fuel, and can create serious hazards. Choose fire only when it materially improves safety or mission. Obey local restrictions and practice Leave No Trace.

## Fire Triangle
All fires need fuel, heat, and oxygen. Balance these for reliable starts.

- Fuel: Tinder (catches spark), kindling (pencil to thumb size), fuelwood (wrist to forearm size). Dryness matters more than species.
- Heat: Sparks, flame, or ember—protected from wind and rain; maintain heat by adding fuel gradually.
- Oxygen: Don’t smother the core; structure stacks to allow airflow.

## Ignition Sources
### Ferro Rod
Shower of hot sparks; works wet; nearly endless strikes.

- Scrape spine of a sharp knife/scraper down the rod; lock scraper, move rod for control.
- Tinder: Fine, dry fibers—cotton with petroleum jelly, birch bark curls, fatwood dust, scraped inner bark.
- Build a small tinder bundle with a shallow “nest”; shower sparks into the nest; add pencil‑lead kindling as soon as it flames.

### Lighter
Fastest reliable flame; protect from wind/wet.

- Shield with your body; create a small windbreak; pre‑split kindling so flame contacts edges.
- Carry two lighters in separate places; tape one’s fuel button to prevent discharge.

### Battery + Steel Wool (Safety)
For emergencies when other methods fail.

- Use fine steel wool (0000). Stretch to increase resistance; touch both battery terminals (9V easiest) to fibers until they glow; blow gently and transfer to tinder bundle.
- Precautions: Fire hazard; don’t pocket used wool; avoid near gas vapors; don’t short lithium cells.

## Fire Lays
### Teepee
Kindling leaned in a cone around tinder; great for fast ignition and signaling flame; fragile in wind and wet.

### Log Cabin
Square stack around teepee core; stable, good airflow, easy to feed; nice for cooking coals.

### Long Fire
Two parallel logs with space between; excellent radiant heat for sleeping next to or boiling long pots; feed from ends.

💡 Tip: In wet conditions, split logs expose dry inner wood; baton safely to create dry kindling.

## Wet-Weather Starts
Pre‑plan for wet. Seek dry from the inside out.

- Fuel sources: Dead standing wood, inner heartwood, fatwood (resin‑rich), birch bark (oily), conifer cones.
- Feather sticks: Carve thin curls into split sticks to increase surface area; keep attached; ignite curls first.
- Platform: Build on a dry base (bark/green sticks) to keep tinder off wet ground or snow.
- Canopy: Pitch a tarp/poncho partial roof while you work.

## Ember Tending
Once you have coals, guard them—they’re your banked heat.

- Feed steadily with similar‑size pieces to avoid smothering.
- Create a coal bed for cooking; rake coals for even heat.
- If leaving temporarily, cover with ashes to slow burn; revive with airflow and small fuel.

## Safety
### Carbon Monoxide Risks
Never burn stoves or fires inside enclosed, unventilated shelters or vehicles. Use a CO detector when possible; keep ventilation.

### Clearances
Clear a wide area to mineral soil; remove duff; build a small ring if appropriate; keep spark arrestors on stoves.

### Extinguishing
Cold‑out standard: Drown, stir, drown again. Feel for heat with the back of your hand. If it’s too hot to touch, it’s too hot to leave.

### Leave No Trace
Prefer existing fire rings; keep fires small; burn only small dead/down wood; scatter cold ashes; restore site to natural appearance.

⚖️ Legal: Obey fire bans and local regulations; penalties can be severe and fires destructive.

☑️ Checklist — Fast, Safe Fire
- Need confirmed (heat/dry/signal)? If not, skip the fire
- Site safe: clear to mineral soil; wind manageable; water/dirt on hand
- Tinder ready, then pencil‑lead kindling, then pencil‑thick, then thumb‑thick
- Ignition source tested and backup present
- Plan to cook/heat? Choose lay accordingly (cabin/long fire)
- Cold‑out plan: drown, stir, hand‑check before leaving/sleeping

Examples
- Cold/wet afternoon: Split dead standing wood; feather sticks under tarp edge; ferro rod to cotton/vaseline; build small log cabin; boil water; cold‑out before sleep.
- High fire danger: No open flame; use stove in designated area with clear mineral soil; or skip heat, focus on layers, shelter, hot drinks from insulated bottle.

## Common Mistakes
- Building big before building hot; smothering tinder with heavy fuel.
- Gathering wet ground wood instead of splitting to dry inner wood.
- Lighting under low branches or near duff in wind; poor clearances start spot fires.
- Ignoring fire bans or leaving half‑out fires; burying coals instead of cold‑out.
- Running stoves or open flames in enclosed shelters or vehicles; CO hazards.
- On snow: No platform—fire sinks and drowns; build a base of green sticks/bark.

## Key Takeaways
- Fire is a tool, not a goal—use it when it improves safety, warmth, or signaling.
- Structure airflow and dry inner wood; build small and controlled, especially in wind/wet.
- Extinguish to true cold‑out; follow laws and Leave No Trace.

## Scenarios

> 🧭 Scenario (Wet forest): Kindling soaked; morale low.
> 🔍 Decisions: Burn time on a fire vs layers; tinder choice.
> ✅ Outcome: You split to dry cores, carve feather sticks, light cotton/vaseline with a ferro rod, and build a small log cabin; hot drink restores morale.
> 🧠 Lessons: Dry inner wood + structure + patience
> 🏋️ Drill: Start a fire in rain under a tarp edge.

> 🧭 Scenario (High fire danger):
> 🔍 Decisions: Fire vs stove vs no flame.
> ✅ Outcome: You skip open flame, use a stove on mineral soil, and rely on insulation.
> 🧠 Lessons: “No fire” is often the safest choice
> 🏋️ Drill: Pack a “hot drink without fire” kit.
