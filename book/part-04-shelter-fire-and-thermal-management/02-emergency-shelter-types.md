# Emergency Shelter Types

## Overview
Shelter buys you time by slowing heat loss or gain. Prioritize ground insulation, wind control, and moisture management before fancy roofs. Build fast, small, and strong; add comfort later. Ventilate to control condensation and avoid CO risk.

## Debris Hut
Insulated, low profile, good for cold still nights with minimal kit.

- Materials: Ridgepole (body length + 30–60 cm), two sturdy supports (Y‑sticks or tree), ribs (arm‑thick), heaps of dry leaves/duff/grass.
- Steps: Build a low A‑frame entrance just wider than shoulders; lay ribs down to ground; pile 30–60 cm of dry debris (more in cold/wet); add a thin weather layer (bark, evergreen boughs) if available.
- Floor: Thickest insulation under you (duff, boughs, pad if you have it).
- Size: Just big enough to crawl in and turn—smaller warms faster.
- Door: Plug with a debris bundle after you enter; leave a fist‑size vent.

⚠️ Caution: Never use live branches from protected species; follow Leave No Trace and local regulations.

## A-Frame Tarp
Fast, weatherworthy shelter for rain/wind.

- Ridgeline: Between two anchors (trees/trekking poles). Pitch low and narrow for storms; higher/wider for ventilation.
- Orientation: Narrow end toward prevailing wind; leave lee side slightly lower.
- Edges: Stake taut; add mid‑panel guylines for strength; dig a small drip trench only where permitted.
- Ground: Use a groundsheet; slope away; add a pad and extra insulation.

💡 Tip: Add a short beak/porch by offsetting one corner or using a second small sheet.

## Lean-To
Useful when you have a heat source or need an open face for visibility.

- Structure: Upright supports and a slightly angled roof sloping away from wind.
- Wind: Put back to wind; use natural windbreaks; add side walls from brush or extra tarp edges.
- Heat: With a safe, controlled fire and a reflective wall (rocks/foil blanket) in front, radiant heat reflects into the shelter.

⛑️ First Aid: Avoid smoke inhalation; coughing and headache can indicate poor ventilation or CO exposure.

## Snow Trench / Quinzhee
Snow shelters insulate well if built and ventilated correctly.

- Snow trench: Dig a narrow trench just longer than you; roof with skis/branches and a tarp/snow blocks; cover with ≥30–60 cm of snow. Add a small vent hole.
- Quinzhee (snow mound): Pile snow into a dome; let sinter 60–90 minutes; tunnel in and hollow to 30–40 cm wall thickness (check with sticks). Cut a vent; raise a sleeping platform above floor to trap cold air.
- Entrances: Small, low entrance on leeward side; create a cold‑air sump near the door.

⚠️ Caution: Collapse risk. Probe roof regularly; never build where roof failure buries you in hazard (tree wells, over streams). Keep a shovel inside.

## Vehicle Sheltering
Vehicles are solid wind/rain shelters with major caveats.

- Ventilation: Crack windows on the lee side; avoid running engine for heat due to CO risk. If you must run it, do so intermittently with tailpipe completely clear of snow/debris and CO detector if available.
- Heat retention: Insulate windows with reflectix/foam/clothing; block convective drafts; use sleeping bags/pads on seats or floor.
- Signals: Place reflective triangle/lights; conserve battery; avoid draining to 0%.

⚠️ Caution: Never sleep with engine running. Check tailpipe frequently in snow.

## Urban Shelter Strategies
Staying put safely in buildings.

- Stairwells: Often reinforced; good temporary refuge in quakes and fires (unless smoke‑filled). Don’t block egress.
- Interior rooms: Use rooms without exterior glass for wind/hail/tornado; add soft protection (mattress/helmets) from debris.
- Sealing doors/windows: For smoke or dust, seal gaps with wet towels/tape; for heat, hang reflective barriers on sun‑facing windows.

☑️ Checklist — Shelter Priorities
- Ground insulation under you
- Roof/tarp pitched to shed wind/rain toward lee
- Ventilation gap present (reduce condensation/CO risk)
- Site drains; no overhead hazards
- Signal plan visible from shelter (mirror/light/panel)

Examples
- Cold rain, minimal gear: Low A‑frame with all edges tight; thick bed of duff; hot drink; set whistle/flash schedule.
- Deep snow: Snow trench with tarp roof; vent hole; raised bed; candle for minimal warmth (monitored, ventilated).

## Key Takeaways
- Insulate the ground first; a warm back beats a fancy roof.
- Pitch small and low in storms; add ventilation to control condensation.
- Vehicles and buildings can be excellent shelters if you manage ventilation and CO risk.
