# Family/Team Emergency Plan

## Overview
Write it down, share it, and practice. A simple plan beats wishful thinking. Use PACE for both comms and meeting points; print copies for wallets and post on the fridge.

## Rendezvous Points
Choose Primary and Alternates; add maps/directions.

- HOME, NEAR (e.g., neighbor), FAR (out‑of‑area). Note parking, access, and best routes by hazard.

## Out-of-Area Contact
Select a reliable person outside the local area. Everyone texts/calls them with WHO/WHERE/WHEN/WHAT/INTENT if local comms fail.

## Comms Ladders (PACE)
Primary (voice), Alternate (SMS/app), Contingency (FRS/GMRS schedule), Emergency (meet at FAR by time). Write exact channels/times.

## Evacuation Routes
Two+ routes for common hazards (fire, flood, quake). Note choke points, low water crossings, and fuel stops.

## Shelter Options
List options in/out of area; include pet policies. Keep emergency cash for deposits.

## Rally Timelines
Set check‑in times by hazard; define “if no contact by X, go to Y by Z time.”

☑️ Checklist — One‑Page Family Plan
- Contacts: out‑of‑area and local; school/work numbers
- PACE comms with times/channels
- Rendezvous: HOME/NEAR/FAR addresses and maps
- Evac routes with alternates and fuel notes
- Special needs: meds, equipment, pets

Examples
- Wildfire: If AQI>200 or evac advisory issued, load car; if evac order or fire within 5 mi, depart via Route A; check in every 60 min; meet at FAR by 18:00 if comms fail.
- Quake: Family texts out‑of‑area contact; if home unsafe, NEAR meet; if not safe by 2 h, FAR meet.
