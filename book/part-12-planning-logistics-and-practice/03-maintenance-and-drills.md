# Maintenance & Drills

## Overview
Preparedness is a habit. Short, regular checks keep kits current and skills sharp. Drills turn plans into muscle memory and reveal gaps.

## Kit Checks (Monthly/Quarterly)
Calendar recurring checks; tie to seasons.

- Batteries: Replace/charge/rotate; test lights and radios.
- Expirations: Medications, water treatment, food, fire starters.
- Wear/fit: Clothing, boots, gloves sized and intact.
- Documents: Update contact lists and copies.

## Seasonal Refresh
Swap insulation, sun/bug protection, vehicle fluids (washer), and hazards (chains vs heat kit).

## Scenario Practice
Run bite‑size drills: blackout evening, smoke SIP, fire egress, get‑home walk, water boil and filter, first aid scenarios. Time them; take notes.

## Skill Trees
List core skills with next steps (e.g., CPR → Stop the Bleed → Wilderness First Aid). Track progress.

## Training Logs
Simple log with date, skill, what went well, what to change, gear notes.

## After-Action Reviews
Immediately after drills/events: what happened, what went well, what to improve, who owns fixes, by when.

☑️ Checklist — Monthly 30‑Minute Sprint
- Test lights, radios, and battery banks
- Check go‑bags (food/water/meds/clothes)
- Update docs; review PACE cards
- Drill one micro‑scenario (e.g., fire egress)

Examples
- Home blackout drill: Kill main breaker for 30 minutes; light plan works? Fridge temps? Comms? Notes for improvement.
- Get‑home drill: Walk 5 km route with GHB; adjust weight; note time and water.
