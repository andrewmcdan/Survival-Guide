# Water Purification Dosages & Boil Times

## Chlorine (Unscented Household Bleach) Dosages
Strength varies by product; check label.

- 6% sodium hypochlorite
  - Clear water: 2 drops per liter (8 drops/gal); wait 30 min
  - Cloudy water: 4 drops per liter (16 drops/gal); wait 30–60 min
- 8.25% sodium hypochlorite
  - Clear water: 1–2 drops per liter (6 drops/gal); wait 30 min
  - Cloudy water: 3–4 drops per liter (12–16 drops/gal); wait 30–60 min

Slight chlorine smell should be present; if not, repeat dose and wait 15 more minutes.

## Iodine Dosages
2% tincture (guideline; follow label)
- Clear water: ~5 drops/L; 30 min contact
- Cloudy/cold: Double dose and/or 60 min

Avoid in pregnancy/thyroid disease; less effective for Cryptosporidium.

## Boil Durations by Altitude
Bring water to a rolling boil:
- Sea level to 2,000 m / 6,500 ft: 1 minute
- Above 2,000 m / 6,500 ft: 3 minutes

Notes
- Boiling inactivates bacteria, viruses, protozoa; does not remove chemicals.
- Cyanobacteria (blue‑green algae) toxins are not reliably removed by boiling, filtering, or common chemicals—avoid suspect water entirely.

## Chlorine Dioxide
- Follow manufacturer instructions (tablet/drop strength varies)
- Effective for bacteria, viruses, Giardia; requires up to 4 hours for Cryptosporidium

Mark treated vs untreated containers clearly to prevent mixups.
