# At-a-Glance Cards

## MARCH-E
Massive bleeding → Airway → Respiration → Circulation → Hypothermia/Head → Everything else

- Massive bleeding: Direct pressure → hemostatic packing → tourniquet (note time)
- Airway: Head‑tilt chin‑lift or jaw thrust; position of comfort
- Respiration: Expose; seal open chest wounds; sit up if easier to breathe
- Circulation: Pulse/skin; manage shock; elevate legs if no trauma
- Hypothermia/Head: Insulate from ground; wrap; monitor AVPU
- Everything else: Secondary survey; meds/IDs; vitals every 5–15 min

## Hypothermia/Hyperthermia
Hypothermia
- Signs: Shivering → slurred speech → drowsy → shivering stops (worse)
- Actions: Dry layers, wind/water block, warm sweet drinks if alert, heat packs to armpits/groin/neck; handle gently

Hyperthermia
- Signs: Cramps → exhaustion (sweaty, weak) → stroke (altered, very hot)
- Actions: Shade, water/ORS, cool with water and fanning; ice to neck/groin/armpits; call EMS for stroke signs
