# Knots & Lashings

## Core Knots
- Bowline: Fixed loop; rescue and tarp corners
  - Steps: Make a small loop; the “rabbit” comes up through the loop, around the “tree,” and back down the hole. Dress; leave a long tail; add stopper.
  - Uses: Secure around trees/posts; tie‑in for non‑dynamic loads.

- Sheet Bend: Join lines; use double for slick/uneven lines
  - Steps: Make a bight in the thicker line; pass the thinner line up through the bight, around both legs, and tuck under itself.
  - Uses: Extending guylines; tying dissimilar cordage.

- Clove Hitch: Quick anchor; back up with half hitch
  - Steps: Two turns around the object, second crossing over the first; tuck under the last pass.
  - Uses: Start lashings; temporary tie‑offs.

- Constrictor: Powerful binding; difficult to untie
  - Steps: Like a clove hitch with an extra tuck under the crossing turn.
  - Uses: Bind bundles; repair broken straps; expect to cut to release.

- Taut‑Line Hitch: Adjustable guyline
  - Steps: Two wraps toward the anchor on standing line; one wrap away; slide to tension.
  - Uses: Tent guylines; adjustable clotheslines.

- Trucker’s Hitch: Cinch lines with 2:1 advantage
  - Steps: Anchor one end; tie a slip knot loop in the standing part; route the working end through the far anchor and back through the loop; pull to tension; secure with two half hitches.
  - Uses: Tarp ridgelines; load tie‑downs.

- Prusik: Sliding friction hitch on rope
  - Steps: Wrap a loop of smaller cord 2–3 times around the main rope; pass loop through itself; dress evenly.
  - Uses: Progress capture; adjustable attachment on ridgelines.

## Lashings
- Square: Join poles at right angles; start with clove hitch; make 6–8 tight wraps; add 2–3 frapping turns between spars to cinch; finish with clove.
- Diagonal: Stabilize crossing poles under strain; start with a timber hitch across the X; wrap each diagonal; frap; finish secure.
- Shear: Join two poles as a folding bipod; leave a small gap in wraps to allow pivot; splay legs; back‑tie feet.

## Applications at a Glance
- Shelter: Bowline at grommets → trucker’s hitch to tree; taut‑lines at stakes.
- Repairs: Constrictor to bind a cracked pole; clove to start a lashing; sheet bend to extend a guyline.
- Hauling: Trucker’s Hitch for roof loads; add backups after the first mile.

Narrative — Storm Night, Three Knots
When the squall hit, the A‑frame sagged. You re‑tied the ridge with a trucker’s hitch until the tarp sang like a drum. A bowline at the windward corner stopped a grommet tear from spreading. On the leeward side, a taut‑line made quick work of the last adjustment. Back in the bag went three wet gloves—and three knots you won’t forget.
