# Knots & Lashings

## Core Knots
- Bowline: Fixed loop; rescue and tarp corners
- Sheet Bend: Join lines; use double for slick/uneven lines
- Clove Hitch: Quick anchor; back up with half hitch
- Constrictor: Powerful binding; difficult to untie
- Taut‑Line Hitch: Adjustable guyline
- Trucker’s Hitch: Cinch lines with 2:1 advantage
- Prusik: Sliding friction hitch on rope

## Lashings
Square: Join poles at right angles; start with clove, wrap, frap, finish with clove.

Diagonal: Stabilize crossing poles; prevents racking; similar finish.

Shear: Join two poles to form a bipod; leave space in wraps for pivot; spread legs.

Practice until you can tie eyes‑closed.
