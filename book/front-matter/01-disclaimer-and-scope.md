# Disclaimer & Scope

## Legal, Medical, and Jurisdictional Notes
This book is for general information and education. It is not a substitute for professional medical, legal, or technical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Use your judgment, verify information from authoritative sources, and seek qualified help when in doubt.

- Not medical advice: Field care guidance is written for lay responders. Get certified training (e.g., CPR/AED, bleeding control, wilderness first aid) and follow local protocols. Do not perform procedures beyond your training and equipment.
- Not legal advice: Laws vary widely by country, state, and municipality (e.g., trespass, hunting/fishing, radio use, signaling devices, fire bans, knives/tools, vehicle and road laws). You are responsible for knowing and following local laws.
- Ethics and legality: This book avoids illegal methods and destructive techniques. If an action would require bypassing security, violating property rights, or breaking the law, do not do it.
- Good Samaritan concepts: Some jurisdictions offer limited protections to bystanders who render aid in good faith within the scope of their training. These protections and limits vary—consult local guidance.

By using this material, you accept all risks and agree that the authors and publishers are not liable for losses, injuries, or damages resulting from its use or misuse.

## When to Call for Help
If you or someone nearby has any of the following, call emergency services immediately (e.g., 911/112/999) and follow dispatcher instructions:

- Uncontrolled or massive bleeding, major trauma, or amputation
- Chest pain/pressure, shortness of breath, or signs of heart attack
- Stroke signs (FAST: face droop, arm weakness, speech difficulty, time urgent)
- Severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis (trouble breathing, swelling, hives)
- Altered mental status, confusion, or loss of consciousness
- Serious head/neck/spine injury or high-energy mechanism (fall, collision)
- Severe burns, electrical/chemical burns, or burns to face, hands, groin
- Eye injury—especially chemical exposures or penetrating trauma
- Heat stroke, severe hypothermia, or unresponsive from environmental exposure
- Seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures, or first-time seizure
- Suspected envenomation after snakebite with worsening symptoms
- Dehydration in infants/elderly with lethargy, no urination, or sunken eyes
- Any situation that feels beyond your capability or is rapidly worsening

What to communicate when you call:

- Location: best described with plain address and landmarks; include coordinates (Lat/Long or UTM/MGRS) if remote
- Nature of the problem and hazards present (fire, gas, downed lines, unstable structure)
- Number of people, ages, their conditions, and immediate life threats
- Actions taken so far (e.g., bleeding controlled, airway open, epi given)
- Callback number, best access route, and any gate/lock info

If you cannot call: prioritize safety and signaling. Use sound/light signals, pre-arranged radio plans, or a personal locator beacon/satellite messenger if available. Move to a safer location if remaining is life-threatening.

Consent: If a patient is alert, ask permission before helping. If unresponsive or a child without a guardian present, many jurisdictions recognize “implied consent” for lifesaving aid. Stop if a competent adult refuses care.

Scope and intended audience:

- Focus: practical, legal, non-destructive skills for preparedness, emergencies, and short-term survival for laypersons and small groups.
- Exclusions: specialized professional tactics (technical rope rescue, explosives, law-enforcement procedures), invasive medical care beyond lay training, and illegal methods of access or movement.

Competency, training, and equipment:

- Practice skills before emergencies and maintain equipment in working order.
- Use appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, eye protection) and avoid exposure to bodily fluids, smoke, chemicals, electricity, and unstable structures.
- Replace consumables (batteries, meds, water treatment, first aid) per expiration or after use.

Environmental variability and risk:

- Terrain, weather, wildlife, and infrastructure differ by region. Adapt recommendations to local conditions and your abilities.
- Some techniques carry inherent risk. If conditions exceed your training or tools, pause, reassess, and seek help.

Accuracy and updates:

- Content reflects current best practices at the time of writing but may change. Cross-check critical steps with up-to-date, authoritative sources (e.g., local EMS guidance, park/land management advisories, manufacturer manuals).

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Roadside crash): You arrive first. Two cars, one person seated, bleeding from forearm; fuel smell faintly present.
> 🔍 Decisions: Approach or hold? Consent? Move the person or not? Call before touching?
> ✅ Outcome: You park safely, hazards on, place a triangle, call 911 with location and hazards, ask the patient if you may help, glove up, control bleeding with pressure, keep them warm, and do not move them without immediate danger.
> 🧠 Lessons:
> - Scene safety and consent come first
> - You are protected by Good Samaritan concepts only within your training and local laws
> - Document times and actions for handoff
> 🏋️ Drill: Write a 3‑line script you’ll say on arrival and when asking for consent.
