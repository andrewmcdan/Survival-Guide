# How to Use This Book

## What This Is
This is a practical, online-first guide you can skim in minutes or study in depth. Each chapter starts with what to do, then adds why and how. Appendices provide printable quick-reference.

## Icons
To keep callouts consistent and readable across browsers, we use simple Unicode with ASCII fallbacks. Use these markers when drafting content and keep the wording short and action-focused.

- üí° Tip ‚Äî ALT: [tip]
- üìù Note ‚Äî ALT: [note]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution ‚Äî ALT: [caution]
- ‚õî Danger ‚Äî ALT: [danger]
- ‚õëÔ∏è First Aid ‚Äî ALT: [med]
- ‚öñÔ∏è Legal ‚Äî ALT: [legal]
- ‚òëÔ∏è Checklist ‚Äî ALT: [x] / [ ]
- üß∞ Gear ‚Äî ALT: [gear]

Formatting pattern (choose one of the two styles):

1) Inline callout
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: Hot exhaust can ignite dry grass.

2) Label prefix on its own line
‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
- Park on bare soil or pavement before working under a vehicle.

## At-a-Glance Cards
Each major section references matching quick cards in Appendices. Use them for training and as ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù refreshers. See: Appendices ‚Üí At-a-Glance Cards, Signal Library, Knots, Water Dosages, and Checklists.

## Navigation & Structure
- Parts I‚ÄìXII are topic clusters. Skim ‚ÄúIntros‚Äù and jump to the task you need.
- Chapters are short, scannable modules with headings you can link to directly.
- Appendices contain single-page references intended for printing or offline copies.

## What We Don‚Äôt Use
- Color tabs: Omitted for the web. Headings, icons, and clear links replace color coding.

## Checklists
- Use `[ ]` for an empty box and `[x]` when demonstrating a completed item.
- Keep items single-action and verifiable (no multi-step bullets in one line).

Example:
- [ ] Water: container, pre-filter, treatment method
- [ ] Light: headlamp, spare batteries
- [ ] Comms: charged phone, offline map, PACE plan card

## Skill Levels
To set expectations, we may label tasks:
- Basic ‚Äî safe for most readers after a quick read-through
- Intermediate ‚Äî practice recommended before real use
- Advanced ‚Äî requires training, supervision, or specialized gear

## Measurements & Conventions
- Units: SI first, US customary in parentheses when useful (e.g., 1 L (34 fl oz)).
- Time: 24-hour format for logs and plans; use local time zone.
- Coordinates: Show format and datum (e.g., 37.7749¬∞ N, 122.4194¬∞ W; WGS84) and include UTM/MGRS when relevant.
- Terms: The first appearance of a model or acronym expands in-line (e.g., PACE: Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency).

## Safety First
When a step trades time for safety, we prefer safety. If a task exceeds your training, stop, stabilize, and seek help. See: Disclaimer & Scope.

## Offline Use
- Save important chapters as PDFs or print quick cards for kits.
- Consider a preloaded offline map app and locally saved checklists.

## Contributing & Feedback
If you spot a mistake or have a practical improvement, open an issue or submit a concise example that improves clarity and safety. Real-world observations matter.
