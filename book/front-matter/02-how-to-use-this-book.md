# How to Use This Book

## What This Is
This is a practical, online-first guide you can skim in minutes or study in depth. Each chapter starts with what to do, then adds why and how. Appendices provide printable quick-reference.

## Icons
To keep callouts consistent and readable across browsers, we use simple Unicode with ASCII fallbacks. Use these markers when drafting content and keep the wording short and action-focused.

- 💡 Tip — ALT: [tip]
- 📝 Note — ALT: [note]
- ⚠️ Caution — ALT: [caution]
- ⛔ Danger — ALT: [danger]
- ⛑️ First Aid — ALT: [med]
- ⚖️ Legal — ALT: [legal]
- ☑️ Checklist — ALT: [x] / [ ]
- 🧰 Gear — ALT: [gear]

Formatting pattern (choose one of the two styles):

1. Inline callout
> ⚠️ Caution: Hot exhaust can ignite dry grass.

1. Label prefix on its own line
⚠️ Caution
- Park on bare soil or pavement before working under a vehicle.

## At-a-Glance Cards
Each major section references matching quick cards in Appendices. Use them for training and as “just-in-time” refreshers. See: Appendices → At-a-Glance Cards, Signal Library, Knots, Water Dosages, and Checklists.

## Navigation & Structure
- Parts I–XII are topic clusters. Skim “Intros” and jump to the task you need.
- Chapters are short, scannable modules with headings you can link to directly.
- Appendices contain single-page references intended for printing or offline copies.

## What We Don’t Use
- Color tabs: Omitted for the web. Headings, icons, and clear links replace color coding.

## Checklists
- Use `[ ]` for an empty box and `[x]` when demonstrating a completed item.
- Keep items single-action and verifiable (no multi-step bullets in one line).

Example:
- [ ] Water: container, pre-filter, treatment method
- [ ] Light: headlamp, spare batteries
- [ ] Comms: charged phone, offline map, PACE plan card

## Skill Levels
To set expectations, we may label tasks:
- Basic — safe for most readers after a quick read-through
- Intermediate — practice recommended before real use
- Advanced — requires training, supervision, or specialized gear

## Measurements & Conventions
- Units: SI first, US customary in parentheses when useful (e.g., 1 L (34 fl oz)).
- Time: 24-hour format for logs and plans; use local time zone.
- Coordinates: Show format and datum (e.g., 37.7749° N, 122.4194° W; WGS84) and include UTM/MGRS when relevant.
- Terms: The first appearance of a model or acronym expands in-line (e.g., PACE: Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency).
- See also: Glossary & Acronyms (Appendices) for quick reference.

## Safety First
When a step trades time for safety, we prefer safety. If a task exceeds your training, stop, stabilize, and seek help. See: Disclaimer & Scope.

## Offline Use
- Save important chapters as PDFs or print quick cards for kits.
- Consider a preloaded offline map app and locally saved checklists.

## Contributing & Feedback
If you spot a mistake or have a practical improvement, open an issue or submit a concise example that improves clarity and safety. Real-world observations matter.

## Scenarios

> 🧭 Scenario (Urban outage, commute): Power fails at dusk. Elevators stop, data crawls, streets clog. Your GHB is under the desk.
> 🔍 Decisions: Stairwell vs wait; route to busier exit; call or text; conserve battery; walk vs rideshare.
> ✅ Outcome: You take stairs, text a short WHO/WHERE/WHEN/WHAT/INTENT update, switch to offline map, walk a known route with headlamp on low.
> 🧠 Lessons:
> - PACE: voice → text → radio → rendezvous
> - Offline maps + battery bank ≫ random scrolling
> - Keep light and whistle on-person
> 🏋️ Drill: Walk your route once in daylight; save an offline map and set a one‑page PACE card.
>
> 🧭 Scenario (Trail day, light rain): Your phone is at 20%. A friend twists an ankle 3 km from trailhead.
> 🔍 Decisions: Duty‑cycle phone; signal; split or stay; shelter now or move.
> ✅ Outcome: You STOP, build a quick A‑frame, send a timed text, then hobble together on a handrail to a known rendezvous.
> 🧠 Lessons:
> - Safety, shelter, signaling before distance
> - “One page” checklists reduce flailing
> 🏋️ Drill: Pack your bag to hit the checklists without digging.
