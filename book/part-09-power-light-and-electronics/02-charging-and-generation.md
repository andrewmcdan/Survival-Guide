# Charging & Generation

## Overview
Charge smart, safely, and with an eye on carbon monoxide risks. Use vehicles, solar, and generators effectively without damaging equipment or endangering people.

## Vehicle Alternator Use
Useful backup if used cautiously.

- Idling charges slowly; better to drive if safe; watch fuel.
- Use proper inverters/USB adapters; avoid overloading the cigarette/accessory socket.
- CO risk: Never idle in enclosed spaces; ensure tailpipe is clear of snow/debris.

## Solar Panel Regulators
Solar for steady daytime charging.

- Regulators: PWM (simple/cheap) vs MPPT (more efficient, esp. in cold/low light).
- Sizing: Panel watts ≥ device draws with buffer; angle to sun; avoid shading.
- Cabling: Use proper gauge; minimize voltage drop; weatherproof connections.

## Generator Safety (CO)
Place outdoors, downwind, far from openings; use CO detectors indoors. Store fuel safely (approved cans), stabilize gas, and cool before refueling.

☑️ Checklist — Charging Plan
- Prioritize critical devices; schedule charge windows
- Vehicle: clear tailpipe; outside only; correct adapters
- Solar: panel + regulator matched; avoid shade; track sun
- Generator: outdoors; CO detector; safe fueling

Examples
- Post‑storm: Vehicle charges phones with engine running outside; solar panel tops power bank by day; generator runs fridge 1–2 h per 4–6 h with CO alarms active.
- Trail basecamp: 60–100 W folding panel to MPPT controller; charges power banks/radios noon to afternoon.

## Key Takeaways
- Never run engines or generators in enclosed/attached structures—CO kills quietly.
- Solar is quiet and safe; MPPT improves harvest in variable light.
- Prioritize charges; avoid draining critical devices to zero.
