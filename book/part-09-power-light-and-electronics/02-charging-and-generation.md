# Charging & Generation

## Overview
Charge smart, safely, and with an eye on carbon monoxide risks. Use vehicles, solar, and generators effectively without damaging equipment or endangering people.

## Vehicle Alternator Use
Useful backup if used cautiously.

- Idling charges slowly; better to drive if safe; watch fuel.
- Use proper inverters/USB adapters; avoid overloading the cigarette/accessory socket.
- CO risk: Never idle in enclosed spaces; ensure tailpipe is clear of snow/debris.

Sizing & etiquette
- Alternators can supply tens of amps, but accessory sockets are usually limited to ~10–15 A; inverters can trip fuses. Prefer direct 12 V USB‑C PD adapters when possible.
- Keep loads modest while idling; a running vehicle is not a generator substitute.

## Solar Panel Regulators
Solar for steady daytime charging.

- Regulators: PWM (simple/cheap) vs MPPT (more efficient, esp. in cold/low light).
- Sizing: Panel watts ≥ device draws with buffer; angle to sun; avoid shading.
- Cabling: Use proper gauge; minimize voltage drop; weatherproof connections.

Power bank strategy
- Charge banks first, then devices from banks; avoids tying devices to panels that fluctuate under clouds.
- Track bank capacity in watt‑hours; plan for at least one full device cycle per critical device.

## Generator Safety (CO)
Place outdoors, downwind, far from openings; use CO detectors indoors. Store fuel safely (approved cans), stabilize gas, and cool before refueling.

⛑️ First Aid: Suspected CO exposure — headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, or unusual sleepiness. Move victims to fresh air immediately, call emergency services, place in recovery position if needed, and monitor breathing. Do not re‑enter enclosed spaces.

Load management
- Prioritize cold chain (fridge/freezer) and critical medical devices; cycle loads to keep average power low.
- Extension cords: Heavy‑gauge outdoor cords; fully uncoil to avoid heat; keep connections off wet ground.

Backfeed warning
- Do not backfeed a home via dryer outlets or improvised cords; it endangers line workers and can start fires. Use a transfer switch installed by a professional.

☑️ Checklist — Charging Plan
- Prioritize critical devices; schedule charge windows
- Vehicle: clear tailpipe; outside only; correct adapters
- Solar: panel + regulator matched; avoid shade; track sun
- Generator: outdoors; CO detector; safe fueling
- Banks: charge banks first; know Wh; assign device priority

Examples
- Post‑storm: Vehicle charges phones with engine running outside; solar panel tops power bank by day; generator runs fridge 1–2 h per 4–6 h with CO alarms active.
- Trail basecamp: 60–100 W folding panel to MPPT controller; charges power banks/radios noon to afternoon.

Narrative — A Quiet Power Day
Morning sun warmed the folding panel on the picnic table. You clipped the MPPT controller to a 20,000 mAh bank and watched the watts settle as a cloud passed. By noon the bank was full; phones topped off from it while the panel stayed busy. The generator didn’t fire all day—no fumes, no noise—because the fridge stayed cold enough with the prior night’s cycle.

## Common Mistakes
- Running generators in garages, near doors, or under windows; lethal CO accumulates.
- Backfeeding homes without transfer switches; endangers line workers and can start fires.
- Idling vehicles in snow with buried tailpipes; CO intrusion into cabins.
- Overloading cigarette/accessory sockets with large inverters; blown fuses/melted plugs.
- Coiling extension cords under load; heat build‑up and fire risk.
- Plugging sensitive electronics directly into “dirty” generator power without surge/voltage protection.

## Key Takeaways
- Never run engines or generators in enclosed/attached structures—CO kills quietly.
- Solar is quiet and safe; MPPT improves harvest in variable light.
- Prioritize charges; avoid draining critical devices to zero.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Post‑storm mix): Fridge warming, phones low, generator in garage…
> 🔍 Decisions: Where to run generator; vehicle charging; solar angle.
> ✅ Outcome: You wheel the generator outdoors downwind, run it in intervals with CO alarms inside, vehicle‑charge phones, and top power banks on solar midday.
> 🧠 Lessons: CO kills—outside only; staggered charging works
> 🏋️ Drill: Place your generator’s “safe spot” now and mark it.
