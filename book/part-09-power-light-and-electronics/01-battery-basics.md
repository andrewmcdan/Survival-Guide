# Battery Basics

## Overview
Power keeps lights, comms, and navigation alive. Choose the right cells, store them properly, and estimate runtime to plan usage. Cold saps performance—keep batteries warm.

## Chemistries
Different jobs, different cells.

- Alkaline: Cheap, common; poor cold performance; risk of leakage in storage.
- NiMH (rechargeable AA/AAA): Good cold performance; low‑self‑discharge types (e.g., Eneloop) store well.
- Li‑ion (18650/21700/phone packs): High energy density; good cold performance; needs proper chargers.

## Series vs Parallel
Series adds voltage; parallel adds capacity (current/runtime). Match cell types and states; do not mix new/old cells or chemistries. Use protected packs when possible.

## Cold-Weather Care
Keep cells warm close to the body; insulate devices; warm spare cells in a pocket; expect reduced capacity.

## Estimating Runtime
Runtime (h) ≈ capacity (mAh) ÷ draw (mA). Duty cycle extends life: a headlamp at 200 mA with a 3,000 mAh 18650 runs ~15 h at 100% on—more at lower modes and intermittent use.

☑️ Checklist — Power Planning
- Inventory devices and cell types (AA/AAA/18650/USB‑C)
- Bring spares: at least one full extra set per critical device
- Standardize where possible (same cells across headlamps)
- Pack chargers/cables; verify current draw and connectors
- Protect from cold/wet; store lithium at ~40–60% for long term

Examples
- Winter hike: Headlamp on low (10–30 lm) for nav; warm spare 18650 in inside pocket; power bank kept warm for phone.
- Home blackout: NiMH AAs rotated; lantern on low; device charging plan by priority.

## Key Takeaways
- Standardize cells; plan duty cycles; keep batteries warm.
- Match series/parallel properly; don’t mix old/new cells.
- Bring at least one full spare set for critical devices.
