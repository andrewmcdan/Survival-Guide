# Battery Basics

## Overview
Power keeps lights, comms, and navigation alive. Choose the right cells, store them properly, and estimate runtime to plan usage. Cold saps performance—keep batteries warm.

## Chemistries
Different jobs, different cells.

- Alkaline: Cheap, common; poor cold performance; risk of leakage in storage.
- NiMH (rechargeable AA/AAA): Good cold performance; low‑self‑discharge types (e.g., Eneloop) store well.
- Li‑ion (18650/21700/phone packs): High energy density; good cold performance; needs proper chargers.

## Capacity in Context
- mAh vs Wh: Convert to Wh for apples‑to‑apples. Wh ≈ (mAh × nominal voltage) ÷ 1000. AA NiMH ~1.2 V, Li‑ion ~3.6–3.7 V.
- Estimating power bank reality: A “10,000 mAh” (at 3.7 V) is ~37 Wh; expect ~30–33 Wh usable after conversion losses.

## Series vs Parallel
Series adds voltage; parallel adds capacity (current/runtime). Match cell types and states; do not mix new/old cells or chemistries. Use protected packs when possible.

## Cold-Weather Care
Keep cells warm close to the body; insulate devices; warm spare cells in a pocket; expect reduced capacity.

## Estimating Runtime
Runtime (h) ≈ capacity (mAh) ÷ draw (mA). Duty cycle extends life: a headlamp at 200 mA with a 3,000 mAh 18650 runs ~15 h at 100% on—more at lower modes and intermittent use.

## Safety Notes (Li‑ion)
- Use reputable cells and chargers; avoid damaged wraps; store spares in cases, not loose with metal.
- Don’t fully discharge Li‑ion regularly; store long‑term at ~40–60% in a cool place.

☑️ Checklist — Power Planning
- Inventory devices and cell types (AA/AAA/18650/USB‑C)
- Bring spares: at least one full extra set per critical device
- Standardize where possible (same cells across headlamps)
- Pack chargers/cables; verify current draw and connectors
- Protect from cold/wet; store lithium at ~40–60% for long term

Examples
- Winter hike: Headlamp on low (10–30 lm) for nav; warm spare 18650 in inside pocket; power bank kept warm for phone.
- Home blackout: NiMH AAs rotated; lantern on low; device charging plan by priority.

## Common Mistakes
- Mixing new and old cells or chemistries in series devices; leaks and failures.
- Storing alkalines in devices long‑term; leakage damages gear—remove for storage.
- Pocketing bare Li‑ion cells with keys/coins; shorting/fire risk—use cases.
- Charging unattended with cheap/unvetted chargers; prefer reputable, protected chargers.
- Leaving cells in hot cars or freezing conditions for long periods; capacity loss/damage.

## Key Takeaways
- Standardize cells; plan duty cycles; keep batteries warm.
- Match series/parallel properly; don’t mix old/new cells.
- Bring at least one full spare set for critical devices.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Winter headlamp save): 0°C and windy; light dims.
> 🔍 Decisions: Swap cell now; warm spare; duty cycle.
> ✅ Outcome: You warm a spare 18650 in a pocket, swap, and finish safely on low mode.
> 🧠 Lessons: Warm cells work; spares buy safety
> 🏋️ Drill: Standardize your devices on one cell type if possible.
