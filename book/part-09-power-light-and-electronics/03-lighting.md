# Lighting

## Overview
Light enables navigation, work, and signaling. Headlamps keep hands free; handhelds reach farther. Control spill to preserve night vision and reduce signature.

## Headlamps vs Handheld
Headlamps for tasks, handhelds for reach/ID.

- Headlamps: Low modes for close work; red mode for night vision; lockout to prevent pocket turn‑on.
- Handhelds: Higher candela for distance ID; use with a clip or lanyard.

## Beam Control
Aim low; shield spill; use red/low modes. Avoid pointing lights at faces (night blindness) or into traffic.

## Improvised Lanterns
Diffuse a light through a translucent bottle or bag; bounce beams off a white surface/ceiling for wide, soft light.

## Signaling with Light
Use SOS or Rule of Three; high strobe for distance; steady low for task. Avoid blinding rescuers.

☑️ Checklist — Light Discipline
- Keep lights on low for tasks; red mode for night
- Use higher modes for signaling only
- Carry spare cells; standardize batteries across devices
- Angle beams down; avoid light pollution outside shelter

Examples
- Trail at night: Headlamp low; handheld for long checks; red mode in camp.
- Urban outage: Lantern made with headlamp + water jug; windows covered to avoid broadcasting.
