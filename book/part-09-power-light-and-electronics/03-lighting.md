# Lighting

## Overview
Light enables navigation, work, and signaling. Headlamps keep hands free; handhelds reach farther. Control spill to preserve night vision and reduce signature.

## Headlamps vs Handheld
Headlamps for tasks, handhelds for reach/ID.

- Headlamps: Low modes for close work; red mode for night vision; lockout to prevent pocket turn‑on.
- Handhelds: Higher candela for distance ID; use with a clip or lanyard.

## Lumens, Candela, and Beam Shape
Lumens measure total light output; candela measures intensity in a direction (throw). A 1,000‑lumen flood may not reach as far as a 300‑lumen high‑candela thrower.

- Throw vs flood: Search/ID favors candela and tight beams; camp chores favor wide, even floods.
- Runtime honesty: “Turbo” modes often step down. Prefer regulated lights with published runtime graphs.

## Color & Comfort
Color temperature and CRI affect how you see details and read maps.

- Warmer (3,000–4,000 K): Less glare in fog/smoke; more comfortable indoors.
- Neutral/cool (4,500–6,500 K): Perceived brighter; good outdoors.
- High CRI (≥90): Better color rendering for first aid and map reading; often slightly lower efficiency.

## Beam Control
Aim low; shield spill; use red/low modes. Avoid pointing lights at faces (night blindness) or into traffic.

## Improvised Lanterns
Diffuse a light through a translucent bottle or bag; bounce beams off a white surface/ceiling for wide, soft light.

## Signaling with Light
Use SOS or Rule of Three; high strobe for distance; steady low for task. Avoid blinding rescuers.

## Safety Around Fuels & Traffic
- Flames and fuel: Keep open flames away from gasoline vapors and solvents; use LED lanterns around fuel.
- Traffic: Use amber or red blinkers for road safety; avoid white beams into oncoming lanes; wear reflective/high‑viz.

## Narrative — The Living Room Lantern Plan
The house went dark at 19:10. You clipped a headlamp to a clear water jug and set it on the coffee table, a soft globe bright enough for reading without glare. A second, high‑candela handheld stayed pocketed for quick checks outside. The kids kept their red modes on during an impromptu board game. When you checked the breaker, you angled your beam down to avoid blinding anyone moving in the hallway.

## Runtime Charts 101 (No Graphs Needed)
Manufacturers publish runtime charts that show how brightness changes over time. Decoding them helps you avoid surprises.

- Regulated vs unregulated: Regulated drivers hold brightness steady, then drop sharply (“cliff”); unregulated lights fade gradually from the start.
- Turbo vs sustainable: Big “turbo” numbers often step down quickly due to heat. Look for medium modes with long, flat runtimes for real work.
- Candela vs lumens at runtime: A light may keep high lumens but lose throw if heat reduces intensity. For distance ID, prioritize sustained candela modes, not just peak lumens.
- Ambient effects: Cold helps cooling (longer high modes); hot, still air shortens them. Headlamps on hats run hotter than on bare heads.

Quick pick heuristic
- Tasks at camp: Choose the lowest mode that’s comfortable (often 5–40 lm) for hours of runtime.
- Navigation: 50–150 lm, bump to higher briefly to check terrain, then back down.
- Signaling/search: Short bursts on high; keep a battery reserve and a second light.

☑️ Checklist — Light Discipline
- Keep lights on low for tasks; red mode for night
- Use higher modes for signaling only
- Carry spare cells; standardize batteries across devices
- Angle beams down; avoid light pollution outside shelter

Examples
- Trail at night: Headlamp low; handheld for long checks; red mode in camp.
- Urban outage: Lantern made with headlamp + water jug; windows covered to avoid broadcasting.

## Common Mistakes
- Running “turbo” constantly; fast step‑downs drain batteries without added utility.
- Blinding partners or responders; aiming beams at faces or traffic.
- Carrying one light and no spare cells; single‑point failures in the dark.
- No lockout: accidental activation in pockets/bags drains batteries.
- Mixing old/new cells or chemistries in multi‑cell lights; risk of leaks or failure.
- Open flame near fuels; use LED around gasoline/solvents.

## Key Takeaways
- Use the right light for the job; preserve night vision.
- Diffuse for working, strobe for signaling.
- Carry spares and standardize cells.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Improvised lantern): Kitchen dark; kids nervous.
> 🔍 Decisions: Headlamp vs handheld; diffuser setup.
> ✅ Outcome: You strap a headlamp around a water jug for diffuse light and keep one handheld for hallway checks.
> 🧠 Lessons: Diffuse for tasks; reserve thrower for checks
> 🏋️ Drill: Build your favorite diffuser and snap a photo for memory.
