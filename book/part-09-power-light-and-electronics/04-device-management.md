# Device Management

## Overview
Treat power like water—allocate by priority, cut waste, and schedule use. Disable radios you don’t need; download content for offline use.

## Burn-Down Priorities
List devices by mission impact.

- 1: Life safety/comm (phone, radio, PLB) — keep charged
- 2: Navigation/light — scheduled checks; low modes
- 3: Comfort/info (entertainment) — last priority

## Airplane Mode
Disable cell/Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth if not needed; enable GPS only for offline maps; set check intervals.

## Dark Theme/Night Discipline
Dark themes and low brightness preserve night vision and extend battery life. Use screen filters at night.

☑️ Checklist — Device Plan
- Offline maps/files done; notifications off
- Power bank at known percent; cables tested
- Check intervals set (e.g., nav every 30 minutes)
- Brightness down; dark themes enabled

Examples
- Camp: Phones in airplane mode; GPS checks on the hour; headlamps red in camp.
- Evac: Family devices prioritized; one device left on for incoming alerts; others off.

## Key Takeaways
- Prioritize life safety devices; duty‑cycle others.
- Airplane mode + offline data saves power.
- Dark themes + low brightness preserve vision and battery.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Family power ladder): Outage for two days.
> 🔍 Decisions: Which device stays on; who carries the bank; check cadence.
> ✅ Outcome: One phone stays on for alerts, others cycle off; banks rotate; check‑ins hourly then 6‑hourly overnight.
> 🧠 Lessons: Prioritize life‑safety devices; schedule the rest
> 🏋️ Drill: Make a “device priority” sticky for the fridge.
