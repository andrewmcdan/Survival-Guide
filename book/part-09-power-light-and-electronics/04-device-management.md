# Device Management

## Overview
Treat power like water—allocate by priority, cut waste, and schedule use. Disable radios you don’t need; download content for offline use.

## Burn-Down Priorities
List devices by mission impact.

- 1: Life safety/comm (phone, radio, PLB) — keep charged
- 2: Navigation/light — scheduled checks; low modes
- 3: Comfort/info (entertainment) — last priority

## Airplane Mode
Disable cell/Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth if not needed; enable GPS only for offline maps; set check intervals.

## Dark Theme/Night Discipline
Dark themes and low brightness preserve night vision and extend battery life. Use screen filters at night.

☑️ Checklist — Device Plan
- Offline maps/files done; notifications off
- Power bank at known percent; cables tested
- Check intervals set (e.g., nav every 30 minutes)
- Brightness down; dark themes enabled

Examples
- Camp: Phones in airplane mode; GPS checks on the hour; headlamps red in camp.
- Evac: Family devices prioritized; one device left on for incoming alerts; others off.
