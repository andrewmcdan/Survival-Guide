# Device Management

## Overview
Treat power like water—allocate by priority, cut waste, and schedule use. Disable radios you don’t need; download content for offline use.

## Burn-Down Priorities
List devices by mission impact.

- 1: Life safety/comm (phone, radio, PLB) — keep charged
- 2: Navigation/light — scheduled checks; low modes
- 3: Comfort/info (entertainment) — last priority

## Airplane Mode
Disable cell/Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth if not needed; enable GPS only for offline maps; set check intervals.

## Dark Theme/Night Discipline
Dark themes and low brightness preserve night vision and extend battery life. Use screen filters at night.

## Power Math in Plain Terms
- mAh vs Wh: Power banks labeled in mAh assume 3.7 V cells. Usable Wh ≈ (mAh × 3.7) ÷ 1000, minus conversion losses (~10–20%).
- Example: A “10,000 mAh” bank ≈ 37 Wh; at 5 V out with losses, ~30–33 Wh usable → about one full modern phone charge plus some.

## Cables & Chargers Matter
- Short, quality cables reduce losses and flaky connections; label by device type.
- USB‑C PD vs older USB: A PD charger/bank negotiates higher voltages for faster/efficient charge when both sides support it.
- Standardize connectors in your kit where possible; carry one spare.

## Duty Roster for Families/Teams
Designate one device “always‑on” for alerts and emergency calls; others stay off and wake on a schedule (e.g., at the top of the hour).

- Rotate the always‑on role to spread battery use.
- Log check‑in times on paper to avoid waking extra screens.

## Charging Windows
Anchor charging to natural windows: midday solar, generator intervals, or when the vehicle is already running. Don’t idle solely to charge if avoidable.

☑️ Checklist — Device Plan
- Offline maps/files done; notifications off
- Power bank at known percent; cables tested
- Check intervals set (e.g., nav every 30 minutes)
- Brightness down; dark themes enabled
- One device “always‑on” designated; rotation noted

Examples
- Camp: Phones in airplane mode; GPS checks on the hour; headlamps red in camp.
- Evac: Family devices prioritized; one device left on for incoming alerts; others off.

Narrative — Two Phones, One Plan
Your phone stayed off in a jacket pocket next to the warm power bank. Your partner’s phone was the “always‑on” alert device. At the top of each hour you powered up, synced messages, sent a quick WHO/WHERE/WHEN/WHAT/INTENT update, marked the time on a sticky note, and went dark again. The bank stayed above one bar because you charged during the sunny window at lunch.

## Key Takeaways
- Prioritize life safety devices; duty‑cycle others.
- Airplane mode + offline data saves power.
- Dark themes + low brightness preserve vision and battery.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Family power ladder): Outage for two days.
> 🔍 Decisions: Which device stays on; who carries the bank; check cadence.
> ✅ Outcome: One phone stays on for alerts, others cycle off; banks rotate; check‑ins hourly then 6‑hourly overnight.
> 🧠 Lessons: Prioritize life‑safety devices; schedule the rest
> 🏋️ Drill: Make a “device priority” sticky for the fridge.
