# Evacuation, Triage & Handover

## Overview
In multi‚Äëpatient or remote incidents, sort first, lifesave fast, prevent hypothermia, and move safely. Use simple triage models (START/SALT), package patients to protect airway/spine and warmth, and give structured handoffs (MIST/SAMPLE) with times.

## START
Simple triage to prioritize care in multi‚Äëpatient incidents.

- RPM: Respirations, Perfusion, Mental status.
- Respirations: Not breathing ‚Üí open airway; if still not breathing, tag Black (deceased/expectant). Breathing >30/min ‚Üí Red (immediate).
- Perfusion: Cap refill >2 s or no radial pulse ‚Üí Red.
- Mental status: Cannot follow commands ‚Üí Red; can follow ‚Üí Yellow (delayed) if not Red; walking wounded ‚Üí Green (minor).

## SALT
Structured approach from initial sort to transport.

- Sort: Identify those who can/will walk (Green), wave (Yellow), and still (possible Red/Black).
- Assess: Quick look for life‚Äëthreats.
- Lifesaving interventions: Control major bleed, open airway, chest seals, recovery position.
- Treatment/Transport: Assign priority based on condition and resources.

## Packaging Patients
Protect the patient during movement.

- Spinal considerations: Inline stabilization if mechanism suggests; minimize movement.
- Litter: Use commercial or improvised (poles + tarp/blankets). Practice before you need it.
- Hypothermia: Wrap in insulating layers and a wind/water barrier (hypo wrap/bivy); insulate from ground.
- Monitor: Reassess vitals en route; secure dressings and splints.

## Handoff Information
Give a concise, structured report to higher care.

- MIST: Mechanism of injury/illness, Injuries found, Signs (vitals), Treatments given.
- SAMPLE: Symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past history, Last intake, Events.
- Times: Onset, treatment times (tourniquet application, medications), last vitals.

‚òëÔ∏è Checklist ‚Äî Evac/Triage/Handover
- Triage tags or clear prioritization (Red/Yellow/Green/Black)
- Immediate lifesaving interventions done (bleeding, airway, chest)
- Hypothermia prevention in place
- Safe packaging for transport; monitor en route
- Handoff uses MIST + SAMPLE; times documented

Examples
- Multi‚Äëbike crash: Direct pressure/TQ on severe bleed; START triage assigns Red/Yellow/Green; call EMS; MIST handoff with TQ time, vitals trends.
- Remote ankle fracture: Splint and hypo wrap; slow carry with frequent checks; handoff with mechanism, neuro checks before/after splint, pain course.

## Common Mistakes
- Jumping into detailed treatment before triage; misallocating scarce time and resources.
- Omitting hypothermia prevention during packaging and transport.
- Excessive patient movement without indications for spinal protection or stabilization.
- Poor documentation and handoffs (missing times, treatments, vitals trends).
- Failing to reassess and update triage as conditions and resources change.

## Key Takeaways
- Triage fast and fairly; lifesaving interventions come before detailed treatment.
- Prevent hypothermia and secure packaging; reassess continuously during movement.
- Deliver structured handoffs (MIST/SAMPLE) with times to speed higher care.

## Scenario

```
üß≠ Scenario (Multi‚Äëcar collision): Three patients, varied injuries.
üîç Decisions: START vs jumping to treatment; who is Red/Yellow/Green; what to tell EMS.
‚úÖ Outcome: You START triage quickly, control a Red bleed, hypo‚Äëwrap, and deliver a MIST report with times.
üß† Lessons: Sort fast, lifesave first, then transport
üèãÔ∏è Drill: Practice START with friends in 3 minutes.
