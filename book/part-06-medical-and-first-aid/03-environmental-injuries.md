# Environmental Injuries

## Snake Bites
### What Not To Do
No cutting, sucking, ice, electric shocks, or alcohol. Do not apply arterial tourniquets (can worsen damage). Don’t try to catch/kill the snake.

### Pressure Immobilization (where appropriate)
Used primarily for neurotoxic elapid bites (e.g., Australia; some Asian/African species). Not recommended for most North/South American pit viper bites (rattlesnakes/copperheads) due to tissue‑damage risk.

- Technique: Wrap a broad elastic bandage firmly (like a snug sprain wrap) over the entire bitten limb starting distally, then immobilize with a splint; keep patient still. Check distal circulation.
- Indications: Local protocols/species. When in doubt in elapid regions, call poison control/EMS.

### Evacuation
Keep the patient calm and still; immobilize the limb at heart level; remove rings/watches; mark swelling line/time.

- Call EMS/Poison Control; transport rapidly to antivenom‑capable facility.
- Provide: Time of bite, species description/photo (only if safe), progression of swelling/pain, allergies/meds.

## Insect Bites & Stings
### Local Reactions
Cold compress 10–20 minutes; elevate; oral antihistamine for itching; monitor 24–48 h.

### Anaphylaxis
Life‑threatening allergic reaction: hives, swelling of lips/tongue, wheeze, breathing difficulty, vomiting, dizziness, drop in blood pressure.

### Antihistamines
Oral antihistamines help itching/swelling; follow label dosing. Non‑drowsy during daytime activity.

### EpiPen Use
If prescribed or available for known allergy, give epinephrine at first sign of systemic reaction.

- Use auto‑injector into outer thigh (through clothing if needed). Hold 3–10 seconds (per device); massage briefly.
- Call EMS. If symptoms persist, a second dose may be needed after 5–15 minutes.

## Hypothermia
Early: Shivering, fumbling, mild confusion. Moderate/severe: Shivering stops, slurred speech, drowsy, slow pulse.

- Passive: Dry layers, wind/water block, insulate from ground; warm, sweet drinks if alert.
- Active: Body‑to‑body heat, heat packs to armpits/groin/neck (wrap in cloth), warmed fluids if trained. Handle gently.

## Hyperthermia
Heat exhaustion: Heavy sweat, weakness, nausea; cool with shade, water, evaporation, and ORS; rest.

Heat stroke (emergency): Altered mental status, very hot skin; call EMS; aggressive cooling—douse with water and fan hard; ice to neck/groin/armpits.

## Frostbite vs Trench Foot
Frostbite: Frozen tissue; numb, waxy, hard skin; blisters after rewarm. Rewarm only if refreezing risk is gone: warm water bath 37–39°C (98–102°F) 15–30 minutes; do not rub. Protect and pad; evacuate.

Trench foot: Cold‑wet exposure without freezing; numb, pale/mottled, painful. Dry, warm, elevate; change socks; gradual rewarm.

## Altitude Sickness
AMS: Headache, nausea, poor sleep at altitude; treat with rest, hydrate, mild pain relief; do not ascend with symptoms.

HACE (brain): Ataxia, confusion; descend immediately; oxygen if available.

HAPE (lungs): Shortness of breath at rest, cough, frothy sputum; descend immediately; oxygen; minimize exertion.

Ascent rules: Climb high, sleep low; >3,000 m (10,000 ft) increase sleeping altitude ≤500 m/day; rest days every ~1,000 m.

## Sun & Eye Protection
Cover skin; use wide‑brim hat; sunglasses with UV protection; apply/reapply sunscreen (SPF 30+). In snow/water, increase protection due to reflection.

☑️ Checklist — Environmental Injury Quick Actions
- Snakebite: Immobilize, pressure immobilization in elapid regions, no cutting/sucking/ice, evac
- Sting allergy: Epi for systemic signs, antihistamine, EMS
- Hypothermia: Insulate ground/back, dry layers, heat packs to core
- Hyperthermia: Shade, water, evaporative cooling, ORS; EMS if stroke signs
- Frostbite: Warm water bath if no refreeze risk; pad and protect; evac
- Altitude red flags: Ataxia or breathlessness at rest → descend now

Examples
- Desert hike: Bee stings with hives/wheeze; administer EpiPen, call EMS, second dose after 10 minutes if wheeze persists; monitor airway.
- Alpine camp: Mild AMS; rest day, hydrate, mild analgesic; postpone ascent; monitor for ataxia.

## Key Takeaways
- Immobilize and evacuate snakebites; use pressure immobilization only in appropriate regions/species.
- Treat allergic reactions early; epinephrine saves lives—use it with systemic signs.
- Prevent and reverse thermal injuries with insulation or cooling; descend immediately with altitude red flags.
