# First Response Flow

## Overview
Do the most good without becoming a casualty. Use a simple, repeatable flow: secure the scene, find and treat life‑threats fast (MARCH‑E), then expand care and plan evacuation. Pair this with clear communication and documentation.

## Scene Safety
Scan before you touch.

- Hazards: Traffic, fire/smoke, electricity, gas, water, unstable structures, rockfall, animals, violence.
- Controls: Move yourself and bystanders to safety, don gloves/eye protection if available, turn off ignition/gas/electricity if safe, chock vehicles.
- Numbers: Count patients; call for help early if multiple.

📝 Note: If the scene is unsafe and you cannot control it, retreat and call for help.

## Primary Survey
Fast check for life‑threats in this order; shout for help or assign tasks as you go.

- Responsiveness: AVPU (Alert, responds to Voice, to Pain, Unresponsive).
- Airway/Breathing: Is the airway open? Are they breathing? If not, start CPR if trained and appropriate.
- Massive bleeding: Look for and control heavy external bleeding immediately.
- Position: Place on back for assessment unless vomiting (recovery position) or trauma suggests spinal care.

## MARCH-E Overview
### Massive Bleeding
Direct pressure first. If ineffective, apply a tourniquet for limbs or pack/junctional pressure for groin/axilla/neck.

- Expose the wound; apply firm, continuous pressure with gauze or clean cloth.
- Tourniquet: Place 5–7 cm (2–3 in) above wound (not over joints). Tighten until bleeding stops; note time.
- Hemostatic gauze: Pack deep bleeding wounds tightly; hold pressure 3+ minutes.

### Airway
Open and maintain the airway.

- Responsive: Let them find a position of comfort; avoid forcing supine if breathing worsens.
- Unresponsive, no spinal concern: Head‑tilt, chin‑lift; clear visible obstructions.
- Suspected spinal: Jaw thrust if trained; avoid head tilt.

### Respiration
Assess rate, depth, symmetry; expose and look for chest wounds.

- Open chest wounds: Cover with vented chest seal if available; if none, improvise with plastic and monitor for respiratory distress.
- Support: Sit up or position of comfort if breathing is painful/difficult.

### Circulation
Check pulse, skin color/temp/cap refill; manage shock.

- Lay flat, elevate legs if no trauma contraindication; keep warm; avoid food/drink in unstable patients.
- Reassess bleeding; treat pain appropriately if trained.

### Hypothermia/Head Injury
Prevent heat loss even in warm weather; monitor brain status.

- Wrap in dry insulation, cover head/neck, insulate from ground (hypo kit/bivy if available).
- Head injury: Monitor AVPU, pupils, changes in behavior; avoid unnecessary movement.

### Everything Else
Secondary head‑to‑toe: Look for other injuries, medical IDs, medications, allergies.

- SAMPLE: Symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past history, Last intake, Events.
- Vitals: Level of responsiveness, pulse, respirations, skin; repeat every 5–15 minutes.

☑️ Checklist — First Response
- Scene safe or controllable
- Call for help early (location, number injured, hazards)
- Primary survey with MARCH‑E interventions
- Prevent hypothermia; insulate from ground
- Secondary survey and vitals; document
- Evacuation plan and handoff ready

Examples
- Bike crash: Massive elbow bleed—direct pressure → tourniquet; airway clear; breathing rapid but effective; wrap in jacket, lay flat; call EMS with location and number injured; monitor and document times.
- Fall on trail: Unresponsive but breathing; jaw thrust to open airway; obvious femur bleed packed and held; insulate; send two to trailhead with precise coordinates while one stays and monitors.

## Key Takeaways
- Safety first; your first patient is you. Control hazards or retreat.
- Use MARCH‑E to find and fix life‑threats before anything else.
- Prevent hypothermia early; reassess vitals and interventions regularly.
- Communicate clearly and document times, treatments, and changes.

## Scenario

> 🧭 Scenario (Bike crash): Rider down, bleeding, breathing fast, shivering in drizzle.
> 🔍 Decisions: Bleeding vs airway first; hypothermia now or later; who calls.
> ✅ Outcome: You control bleeding with pressure/TQ, open airway, seal chest abrasion, insulate from ground, assign a caller with exact location, and monitor.
> 🧠 Lessons: MARCH‑E sequence + insulation early
> 🏋️ Drill: Say MARCH‑E out loud while laying out your kit.
